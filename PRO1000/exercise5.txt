Project Description: GreenCode Initiative Website
The goal of this project is to design and develop a website that promotes sustainable programming practices (Green Software Development). The website will serve as an educational and inspirational platform for building energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible software systems.
Potential Stakeholders:
Primary Users: Software developers interested in sustainable coding practices.
Secondary Users: Students and teachers in computer science using the platform as a learning tool.
Additional Stakeholders: Startups, tech companies, sustainability advocates, and environmental researchers exploring eco-friendly technology.
Possible Customers:
Tech companies and software development firms seeking premium tools and certifications.
Educational institutions subscribing for specialized content.
Sustainability organizations and NGOs funding advanced tools or initiatives.
Suggested Website Structure

Evaluation Criteria
Visual Appeal: Design is sustainable, engaging, and consistent with the green theme.
Functionality: Web pages are accessible and functional.
Content: All required content is present and well-organized.
Quality: Tested with usability and system tests.

Exercise 5 - Develop a simple project charter within 800 words with the following items:
Business Objectives (Forretningsm√•l)
Project Deliveries (Prosjektleveranser)
Project Exclusions (Prosjektets ekskludering)
Constraints (Begrensninger)
Assumptions (Antagelser)
 
Evaluation criteria is the Clarity and Completeness of Business Objectives, Relevance and Detail in Project Deliveries, Appropriateness of Project Exclusions, Identification of Constraints and Validity of Assumptions 
Write feedback with the template as follows: 

First of all, write one sentence to introduce the feedback purpose and, the connection of doing this exercise to the course module - Scope Management. 

Secondly, in the next paragraph, evaluate the answers and give the associating evaluation level. Four levels of evaluation are Level 1 - Unsastifactor, Level 2 - Needs Improvement, Level 3 - Satisfactory and Level 4 - Excellence. For answer in Level 2, level 3 and level 4. Be easy here so if students answer all the four SWOT points the should get at least level 3

Completely Out of Topic: the student writes something unrelated to the exercise, asks questions, or provides irrelevant information. Level 1
Overly Lengthy and Off-Topic: The student includes excessive information unrelated to the assignment requirements, failing to adhere to the 800 word limit. Level 1
Partial Answer: The student addresses only some elements of the project charter (e.g., writes about business objectives but omits exclusions, constraints, or assumptions). Level 2
General and Superficial Answer: The student provides vague or generic statements for each section without detail or relevance to the GreenCode project. Level 2
Misunderstanding the Question: The student misinterprets the exercise, such as providing project management theory instead of focusing on the specific elements of the charter of GreenCode. Level 2
Incorrect or Illogical Content: The student includes incorrect, unrealistic, or illogical points in their charter (e.g., stating assumptions that contradict constraints or irrelevant exclusions). Level 2
Incomplete but Structured Answer: The student organizes their answer well and demonstrates effort but misses minor details or fails to address some aspects comprehensively. Level 3
Excellent but Slightly Unbalanced Answer: The student provides a strong response but gives uneven emphasis to the sections (e.g., excellent exclusions and constraints but weaker assumptions). Level 3
Excellent and Comprehensive Answer: The student thoroughly addresses all elements of the project charter with clear, relevant, and detailed content that aligns with the project requirements. Level 4

Thirdly briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the answer. Quote one good_sentence to illustrate for the strength and put it inside this template :green[good_sentence]. Quote one bad_sentence to illustrate for the weaknesses and put it inside this template :red[bad_sentence]. Note that only giving quotes if the good_sentence or bad_sentence can be found within the student answer.

Fourthly, a headline Action points and then followed bullet points at most three actionable points to address the given feedback. 

Finally, basing on the current evaluation level of this student and what they should do, write a simple question or motivating sentence to encourage the student start with fixing the feedback.
