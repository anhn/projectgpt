•        Project management tools
•        Trelloboard structure suggestion

•        Meta column: Information about the team, project, notation used in the team board 
•        Product backlog column: include the latest version of the project backlog 
•        Sprint 1 backlog: includes the list of backlog items plan for this Sprint 
•        Sprint 1 to-do: when the team start with this Sprint, items from Sprint backlog shall be copied and pasted into this To-do column 
•        Sprint 1 complete: when an item is done, it should be moved from Sprint 1 to-do column to the Complete column. 
•        …
•        Definition of Done
•        Potentially Shippable Product is the sum of the Product Backlog Items delivered each Sprint.
•        Adhering to a list of “done” criteria ensures that the sprint product is truly shippable


•        Project Estimation in Scrum
•        Story points are units of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.
•        Teams assign story points relative to work complexity, the amount of work, and risk or uncertainty.

•        T-shirt size estimation
•        T-shirt sizing is a project estimation tool that helps to track how much time or effort an initiative will take. 
•        Assign each project or task a t-shirt size—from Extra Small to XXL—to represent that task’s relative effort. 
•        Depending on how you choose to use this tool, a t-shirt size can represent task scope, effort, complexity, work hours, time estimates—or all of the above.

•        Project Estimation in Scrum
•        Planing poker
•        Each team member gets a set of cards.
•        Each user story/ item is discussed.
•        Each team member privately selects a card representing his/her estimate.
•        When everyone is ready, all selected cards are revealed at the same time.
•        If all team members selected the same card, then that point value is the estimate.
•        If the cards are not the same, the team discusses the estimate with emphasis placed on the outlying values:
•        The member who selected the lowest value explains why he/she selected the value.
•        The member who selected the highest value explains why he/she selected the value.
•        Select again until estimates converge.
•        Definition of Done (DoD)
•        DoD is a checklist of features and activities, for example, writing code, coding comments, unit testing, integration testing, release notes, design documents, etc. that adds or demonstrates value to the product
•        Definition of Done
•        Definition of Done for a feature ( user story or product backlog item)
•        Definition of Done for a sprint (collection of features developed within a sprint)
•        Definition of Done for a release (potentially shippable state)

•        Definition of Done checklist for An User Story
•        Produced code for presumed functionalities
•        Assumptions of User Story met
•        Project builds without errors
•        Unit test written and passing
•        Project deployed on the test environment identical to production platform
•        Feature is tested against acceptance criteria
•        Documentation updated
•        Definition of Done checklist for Sprint
•        DoD of each single User story, included in the Sprint are met
•        “to do’s” are completed
•        All unit tests passing
•        Product backlog updated
•        Project deployed on the test environment identical to production platform
•        Tests of backward compatibility passed

•        Project management tools
•        Are you still in Trello?
•        Complete view on product backlog?
•        Good balance among:
–        Product development
–        Scrum practice
–        Documentaion
•        Continuous updating your plan?
•        Exercise 1 – Evaluting your team Sprint
•        How much you think it is finished now?
•        What DoD criteria you will use to evaluate ?
•        Conflict handle
•        Common cause
–        Misunderstanding
–        Poor communication
–        Different sight on reality
–        Conflict of interests
–        Confusing in the realtionship to goals, scope, roles, tasks
–        Lack of trust/ respect
–        Lack of leadership and management

•        Conflict handle
•        Conflict handle
–        Willing to meet
–        Have a desire to solve the conflict
–        Define in common what will take up
–        Accept that one thing has several sides
–        Allow others to share their opinions, needs, thoughts
–        Willing to put yourself in “other’s shoes”
–        Find a solution that both can live with
•        Quality Management

•        Quality assurance vs. control

•        (Software) Product Testing
•        Myth: testing comes near the end of information technology product development
–        Fact: testing needs to be done during almost every phase of the systems development life cycle
•        Myth: Software Testers are the only ones responsible for quality
–        Fact: Quality is everyone’s job. Testers and developers should work together
•        Myth: It is a so-called Bug-free Software
–        Fact: Creating bug-free software is basically impossible.
•        Myth: QA is primarily a women dominated career path
–        Fact: There are a lot of women in software testing, but there are also a lot of men

•        Typical life cycle of testing
•        Unit test is done to test each individual component
•        Integration testing to test functionally grouped components
•        System testing tests the entire system as one entity.
•        User acceptance testing is an independent test performed by end users
•        What actually is testing?
•        Inspections VS. testing
•        Software inspections 
–        Concerned with analysis of the static system representation to discover problems  (static verification)
–        May be supplement by tool-based document and code analysis.

•        Software testing 
–        Concerned with exercising and observing product behaviour (dynamic verification)
–        The system is executed with test data and its operational behaviour is observed.

•        Example: what is wrong here?
•        Usability
•        Example 2: What is wrong with this Interface?
•        System testing
•        Focus on testing the interactions between components. 
–        System testing checks that components are compatible, interact correctly and transfer the right data at the right time across their interfaces. 
•        And tests the emergent behaviour of a system. 
•        Types of System Tests
•        Volume
–        Subject product to large amounts of input.
•        Usability
–        Measure user reaction (e.g., score 1-10).
•        Performance
–        Measure speed under various circumstances.
•        Configuration
–        Configure to various hardware / software 
•        Compatibility
–        with other designated applications 
•        Reliability / Availability
–        Measure up-time over extended period.
•        Security
–        Subject to compromise attempts. 
•        Resource usage
–        Measure usage of RAM and disk space etc.
•        Install-ability
–        Install under various circumstances.
•        Recoverability
–        Force activities that take the application down.
•        Serviceability
–        Service application under various situations.
•        Load / Stress
–        Subject to extreme data & event traffic
•        Usability testing
•        Usability testing is all about getting real people to interact with your product and observing their behavior and reactions to it
•        The goal of usability testing is to reveal areas of confusion and uncover opportunities to improve the overall user experience.
•        

•        Usability testing
•        Employing tests with real users helps you:
–        Validate your prototype
–        Confirm your product meets expectations
–        Identify issues with complex flows
–        Complement and illuminate other data points
–        Catch minor errors
–        Develop empathy
–        Ultimately provide a better user experience
•        What is NOT Usability Testing
•        A/B testing: A/B testing can help validate whether a certain approach is working or not, but can't tell you why.
•        Focus groups: goal is to learn people's opinions about a product or service, not to test how they use it.
•        Surveys: do not allow you to actually observe users on the site in action
•        User acceptance testing: a technical test of QA (quality assurance), not a way to evaluate if the product is user-friendly and efficient.
•        User testing

•        Usability Test process
•        Usability testing methods for webs/ apps
•        Usability test – Example at Google
•        How many user to test?
