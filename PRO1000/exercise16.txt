Exercise 16 - Product Backlog to Sprint Backlog
Create a product backlog for the GreenCode website project
Assume that you will have three Sprints, each Sprint last in 3 weeks, split the product backlog items in three Sprint backlogs

Evaluation criteria is the completeness - three Sprints together should include all items from the Product Backlog,  logical assignment - whether the items are appropriately divided among the three Sprint backlogs based on their complexity, dependencies, and importance, ensuring that critical features are addressed first. 

Write feedback with the template as follows: 

First of all, write one sentence to introduce the feedback purpose and, the connection of doing this exercise to the course module - Agile development 

Secondly, in the next paragraph, evaluate the answers and give the associating evaluation level. Four levels of evaluation are Level 1 - Unsastifactor, Level 2 - Needs Improvement, Level 3 - Satisfactory and Level 4 - Excellence. 
Completely Out of Topic: The student writes irrelevant content, asks unrelated questions, or provides an answer that does not address the exercise (e.g., discussing Agile principles without creating a product or Sprint backlog). Level 1
Partial Answer: The student creates a product backlog but does not split it into Sprint backlogs, or only splits part of the product backlog into Sprint backlogs. Level 2
General and Superficial Answer: The student creates vague backlog items (e.g., "Develop website" without specifying features or tasks) and provides no detail on what will be achieved in each Sprint. Level 2
Misunderstanding the Task: The student misinterprets the task, such as providing a task list instead of a backlog or failing to differentiate between product backlog and Sprint backlogs. Level 2
Incomplete or Unbalanced Sprint Backlogs: The student splits the product backlog into Sprints, but the distribution is uneven (e.g., one Sprint is overloaded while another has minimal items) or lacks prioritization. Level 3
Well-Structured but Incomplete Answer: The student creates a clear product backlog and splits it into Sprint backlogs logically, but some items are missing, or minor dependencies are overlooked. Level 3
Excellent but Slightly Unbalanced Answer: The student provides a strong and detailed product backlog and Sprint backlogs but gives unequal emphasis to some Sprints (e.g., overly detailed Sprint 1 but less so for Sprint 2 and 3). Level 4
Excellent and Comprehensive Answer: The student creates a complete, detailed product backlog with well-defined items, logical prioritization, and a balanced division into Sprint backlogs that align with the projectâ€™s goals and timeline. Level 4

Thirdly briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the answer. Quote one good_sentence to illustrate for the strength and put it inside this template :green[good_sentence]. Quote one bad_sentence to illustrate for the weaknesses and put it inside this template :red[bad_sentence]. Note that only giving quotes if the good_sentence or bad_sentence can be found within the student answer.

Fourthly, a headline Action points and then followed bullet points at most three actionable points to address the given feedback. 

Finally, basing on the current evaluation level of this student and what they should do, write a simple question or motivating sentence to encourage the student start with fixing the feedback.
