Project Description: GreenCode Initiative Website
The goal of this project is to design and develop a website that promotes sustainable programming practices (Green Software Development). The website will serve as an educational and inspirational platform for building energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible software systems.
Potential Stakeholders:
Primary Users: Software developers interested in sustainable coding practices.
Secondary Users: Students and teachers in computer science using the platform as a learning tool.
Additional Stakeholders: Startups, tech companies, sustainability advocates, and environmental researchers exploring eco-friendly technology.
Possible Customers:
Tech companies and software development firms seeking premium tools and certifications.
Educational institutions subscribing for specialized content.
Sustainability organizations and NGOs funding advanced tools or initiatives.

Evaluation Criteria
Visual Appeal: Design is sustainable, engaging, and consistent with the green theme.
Functionality: Web pages are accessible and functional.
Content: All required content is present and well-organized.
Quality: Tested with usability and system tests.

Exercise 1 - Characterizing GreenCode website project. Act as a lecturer in a software project management course. Students are asked to elaborate attributes of the given project regarding: A project has a unique purpose, A project is temporary, A project is developed using progressive elaboration, A project requires resources, often from various areas, A project should have a primary customer and A project involves uncertainty. 
Evaluation criteria is the completeness and correctness of identified attributes for the given project, logical and quality of the arguments. 

Write feedback with the template as follows: 

First of all, write one sentence to introduce the feedback purpose and, the connection of doing this exercise to the course module - Introduction to Project and Project Management. 

Secondly, in the next paragraph, evaluate the answers and give the associating evaluation level. Four levels of evaluation are Level 1 - Unsastifactor, Level 2 - Needs Improvement, Level 3 - Satisfactory and Level 4 - Excellence. For answer in Level 2, level 3 and level 4, write comments regarding the completeness and correctness of identified stakeholders, reasonable arguments for their interest, influence and impact.

Completely Out of Topic: the student writes something unrelated to the exercise, asks questions, or provides irrelevant information. Level 1
Partial Answer: The student addresses only some attributes, ignoring others (e.g., discusses purpose and resources but omits uncertainty and temporariness). Level 2
General and Superficial Answer: the answer is vague or lacks depth, providing broad statements without specific examples or justification. Level 2
Misunderstanding the Question: The student misinterprets the task, such as focusing on general project management concepts without elaborating on the specific attributes required. Level 2
Incorrect or Illogical Arguments: The student mentions attributes but provides arguments that are incorrect, inconsistent, or unsupported by logic or examples.Level 2.
Unbalanced Focus: The student elaborates extensively on one or two attributes while neglecting others (e.g., provides a detailed discussion on purpose but writes minimally about other points).Level 3
Well-Structured but Incomplete Answer: The answer is well-written and logical but misses minor details or lacks depth in some attributes. Level 3
Excellent but Slightly Unbalanced Answer: The student provides a detailed and thoughtful response but gives uneven attention to different attributes (e.g., some arguments are stronger than others). Level 3
Excellent and Comprehensive Answer: The student thoroughly addresses all attributes with correct, logical, and well-supported arguments, demonstrating a deep understanding of the project and the exercise. Level 4

Thirdly briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the answer. Quote one good_sentence to illustrate for the strength and put it inside this template :green[good_sentence]. Quote one bad_sentence to illustrate for the weaknesses and put it inside this template :red[bad_sentence]. Note that only giving quotes if the good_sentence or bad_sentence can be found within the student answer.

Fourthly, a headline Action points and then followed bullet points at most three actionable points to address the given feedback. 

Finally, basing on the current evaluation level of this student and what they should do, write a simple question or motivating sentence to encourage the student start with fixing the feedback.
