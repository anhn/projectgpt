Project Description: GreenCode Initiative Website
The goal of this project is to design and develop a website that promotes sustainable programming practices (Green Software Development). The website will serve as an educational and inspirational platform for building energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible software systems.
Potential Stakeholders:
Primary Users: Software developers interested in sustainable coding practices.
Secondary Users: Students and teachers in computer science using the platform as a learning tool.
Additional Stakeholders: Startups, tech companies, sustainability advocates, and environmental researchers exploring eco-friendly technology.
Possible Customers:
Tech companies and software development firms seeking premium tools and certifications.
Educational institutions subscribing for specialized content.
Sustainability organizations and NGOs funding advanced tools or initiatives.
Suggested Website Structure

Quality: Tested with usability and system tests.

Exercise 6 - List All Activities in the Project by Phase: Planning, Executing, and Closing
Description:
In this exercise, students will identify and categorize all activities involved in the GreenCode Website project into three distinct phases: Planning, Executing, and Closing. This exercise helps students understand the project lifecycle and the sequence of activities required to manage a project effectively. Students will gain practical experience in organizing tasks, ensuring nothing critical is overlooked, and aligning their efforts with project goals.

Evaluation criteria are completeness, ensuring all relevant activities for planning, executing, and closing phases are identified and specific to the GreenCode Website project, relevance - assessing how well activities align with project objectives, are categorized logically.
Example of Activities by Phase
1. Planning Phase:
Define project goals and objectives (e.g., promoting sustainable programming practices).
Identify stakeholders and determine their expectations.
Develop a work breakdown structure (WBS) to outline tasks.
Create a timeline and Gantt chart to map task dependencies and deadlines.
Allocate resources, including tools (e.g., Figma, WordPress) and team roles.
Identify potential risks and create a risk register with mitigation strategies.
Develop a communication plan for team and stakeholder updates.
Draft the project charter.
2. Executing Phase:
Design wireframes and prototypes for website pages using Figma.
Create and test interactive prototypes for usability and accessibility.
Develop website content, including blogs, case studies, and toolkit resources.
Build the website using chosen tools (e.g., Wix, WordPress, or custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
Test website functionality, including navigation, links, and responsiveness.
Make iterative improvements based on feedback from usability and system testing.
3. Closing Phase:
Present the final project deliverable to stakeholders (e.g., educators and peers).
Conduct a project retrospective to reflect on what went well and areas for improvement.
Compile final project documentation, including a summary of achievements, lessons learned, and feedback received.
Host and publish the website for course purposes, ensuring accessibility and functionality.
Celebrate project completion and acknowledge team contributions.

First of all, write one sentence to introduce the feedback purpose and, the connection of doing this exercise to the course module - Scope Management. 

Secondly, in the next paragraph, evaluate the answers and give the associating evaluation level. Four levels of evaluation are Level 1 - Unsastifactor, Level 2 - Needs Improvement, Level 3 - Satisfactory and Level 4 - Excellence. For answer in Level 2, level 3 and level 4. Be easy here so if students answer all the four SWOT points the should get at least level 3

Completely Out of Topic: the student writes something unrelated to the exercise, asks questions, or provides irrelevant information. Level 1
Partial Answer: The student addresses only one or two phases (e.g., lists activities for the Planning Phase but omits Executing and Closing phases). Level 2
General and Superficial Answer: The student provides vague or generic statements for each section without detail or relevance to the GreenCode project. Level 2
Misunderstanding the Question: The student misinterprets the exercise, such as listing generic project management concepts instead of specific activities for each phase. Level 2
Incorrect Categorization: The student lists activities but misclassifies them into incorrect phases (e.g., placing closing activities under the executing phase). Level 2
Incorrect or Irrelevant Activities: The student includes some relevant activities but misses key ones, or includes activities that are irrelevant to the project (e.g., advanced backend development). Level 2
Structured but Incomplete Answer: The answer is well-organized, with clear categories for each phase, but it lacks sufficient detail or misses some minor elements. Level 3
Excellent but Slightly Unbalanced Answer: The student provides a strong and relevant response but gives uneven emphasis to the phases (e.g., detailed Planning phase but shorter descriptions for Executing and Closing). Level 3
Excellent and Comprehensive Answer: The student addresses all phases (Planning, Executing, and Closing) thoroughly with relevant, detailed, and logically categorized activities, demonstrating a clear understanding of the project lifecycle. Level 4

Thirdly briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the answer. Quote one good_sentence to illustrate for the strength and put it inside this template :green[good_sentence]. Quote one bad_sentence to illustrate for the weaknesses and put it inside this template :red[bad_sentence]. Note that only giving quotes if the good_sentence or bad_sentence can be found within the student answer.

Fourthly, a headline Action points and then followed bullet points at most three actionable points to address the given feedback. 

Finally, basing on the current evaluation level of this student and what they should do, write a simple question or motivating sentence to encourage the student start with fixing the feedback.
