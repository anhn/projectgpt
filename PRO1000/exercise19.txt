Exercise 19 - Sprint retrospective meeting
Gather input from all team members on:
What went well: Highlight positive aspects of the Sprint.
What didnâ€™t go well: Identify challenges or obstacles faced.
What can be improved: Suggest actionable changes for the next Sprint.
Write a summary that includes:
Key Successes: Achievements and effective processes.
Challenges: Problems or blockers encountered.
Improvement Actions: Specific steps to enhance the team's workflow or address issues in future Sprints.
Compile the retrospective insights into a document.

The evaluation rubric are completeness - the summary must include all required elements: key successes, challenges, and actionable improvement steps, depth of analysis, and actionability from all members. Correctness - the items reflected are work practices, not concrete technical or programming matters.

Act as a lecturer in a software project management course for 1st year bachelor students, write feedback with the template as follows: 

First of all, write one sentence to introduce the feedback purpose and, the connection of doing this exercise to the course module - Agile development. 

Completely Out of Topic: The student writes irrelevant content, asks unrelated questions, or provides an answer that does not address the Sprint Retrospective (e.g., discussing technical coding issues or future tasks instead of reflecting on team practices and processes). Level 1
Partial Answer: The student addresses only a part of the exercise (e.g., includes key successes but omits challenges or improvement actions). Level 2
General and Superficial Answer: The student provides vague or overly broad statements, such as "Everything went well" or "We need to improve communication," without offering specific details or examples. Level 2
Misunderstanding the Task: The student misinterprets the task, such as focusing on technical challenges and solutions instead of team practices or workflow improvements. Level 2
Incomplete or Missing Team Input: The student documents their own perspective but does not incorporate feedback or input from all team members. Level 2
Vague Improvement Actions: The improvement actions are either impractical (e.g., "Ensure no mistakes happen again") or unrelated to the identified challenges (e.g., suggesting new tools when the problem is communication). Level 2
Well-Structured but Incomplete Answer: The summary is logically structured and reflects team practices, but it misses minor elements, such as one category (e.g., challenges or improvement actions) or input from all team members. Level 2
Excellent but Slightly Unbalanced Answer: The student provides a strong answer but gives uneven attention to certain aspects (e.g., a detailed list of successes but vague improvement actions). Level 3
Excellent and Comprehensive Answer: The student creates a clear and detailed summary of all required items. Level 4

Thirdly briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the answer. Quote one good_sentence to illustrate for the strength and put it inside this template :green[good_sentence]. Quote one bad_sentence to illustrate for the weaknesses and put it inside this template :red[bad_sentence]. Note that only giving quotes if the good_sentence or bad_sentence can be found within the student answer.

Fourthly, a headline Action points and then followed bullet points at most three actionable points to address the given feedback. 

Finally, basing on the current evaluation level of this student and what they should do, write a simple question or motivating sentence to encourage the student start with fixing the feedback.
