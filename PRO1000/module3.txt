•        Viktigheten av prosjektplaner
•        Ledere nevner ofte å levere prosjekter i tide som en av sine største utfordringer.
•        50 prosent av IT-prosjektene ble utfordret i CHAOS-studien fra 2003, og deres gjennomsnittlige tidsoverskridelse økte til 82 prosent fra et lavpunkt på 63 prosent i 2000.
•        *Tidsplanspørsmål er hovedårsaken til konflikter på prosjekter, spesielt i andre halvdel av prosjekter.
•        Tid har minst mulig fleksibilitet; det går over uansett hva som skjer på et prosjekt.
•        Prosjektplanen definerer hvilke ressurser som kreves for å fullføre prosjektet, inkludert menneskelige ressurser, økonomi, tid og utstyr. Dette hjelper med å sikre at nødvendige ressurser er tilgjengelige når de trengs.
•        Tidsplankonflikt
•        Tidsplankonflikt oppstår når det er uoverensstemmelser eller problemer knyttet til tidslinjen eller tidsplanen for ulike oppgaver, aktiviteter eller hendelser i et prosjekt eller i ulike deler av en organisasjon. Dette kan føre til forsinkelser, overbokning av ressurser, prioriteringsproblemer og andre utfordringer som kan påvirke prosjekter eller daglig drift.
–        Ressurskonflikt: Dette oppstår når de samme ressursene er nødvendige for å fullføre flere oppgaver eller prosjekter samtidig. For eksempel, hvis en bestemt gruppe ansatte er nødvendige for to prosjekter som kolliderer i tid, kan det oppstå en ressurskonflikt.
–        Avhengighetskollisjon: Når det er avhengigheter mellom ulike oppgaver eller prosjekter, kan en forsinkelse i en oppgave føre til en forsinkelse i en annen, og dette kan føre til en tidsplankonflikt.
–        Prioriteringsproblemer: Når det er uklarhet om hvilke oppgaver eller prosjekter som skal prioriteres, kan det oppstå en konflikt. Dette kan skje når ulike interessenter har ulike synspunkter på hva som er viktigst.
–        Overbokning av ressurser: Hvis ressurser som ansatte, utstyr eller fasiliteter er overbooket på en slik måte at de ikke kan brukes til alle nødvendige oppgaver samtidig, oppstår en tidsplankonflikt.
–        Konflikt mellom prosjekter: I organisasjoner som administrerer flere prosjekter samtidig, kan konflikter oppstå når det er begrensede ressurser, og det er behov for å prioritere mellom prosjektene.

•        Prosjekttidsstyring
•        Prosjekttidsstyring involverer prosesser og aktiviteter for å sikre at et prosjekt fullføres innenfor den angitte tidsrammen og at prosjektplanene administreres effektivt. Det er et av de sentrale kunnskapsområdene innen prosjektledelse. 
•        Prosjekttidsstyringsprosessene, som definert av Project Management Institute (PMI), inkluderer seks hoved områder

•        Prosjekttidsstyring
•        Planlegging av prosjektets tid
•        Definere aktiviteter
•        Sekvensering av aktiviteter
•        Estimering av aktivitetsressurser
•        Utvikling av prosjekttidsplanen
•        Styring av prosjektets tidsramme

        1. Aktivitetsdefinisjon
•        En aktivitet eller oppgave er et element av arbeid som normalt finnes på WBS som har en forventet varighet, en kostnad og ressurskrav.
•        Prosjektplaner vokser ut av de grunnleggende dokumentene som starter et prosjekt.
–        Prosjektet charter inkluderer start- og sluttdatoer og budsjettinformasjon.
–        Omfangserklæringen og WBS er med på å definere hva som skal gjøres.
•        Aktivitetsdefinisjon innebærer å utvikle en mer detaljert WBS og støttende forklaringer for å forstå alt arbeidet som skal gjøres, slik at du kan utvikle realistiske kostnads- og varighetsestimater.
•        2. Aktivitetssekvensering
•        Innebærer å gjennomgå aktiviteter og bestemme avhengigheter. En avhengighet eller et forhold er relatert til rekkefølgen av prosjektaktiviteter eller oppgaver
–        Obligatoriske avhengigheter: Iboende i arten av arbeidet som utføres på et prosjekt; noen ganger referert til som hard logikk.
–        Skjønnsmessige avhengigheter: Definert av prosjektgruppen; noen ganger referert til som myk logikk og bør brukes med forsiktighet fordi de kan begrense senere planleggingsalternativer.
–        Eksterne avhengigheter: Involvere forhold mellom prosjekt- og ikke-prosjektaktiviteter
•        Du må bestemme avhengigheter for å bruke kritisk baneanalyse.
•        2. Aktivitetssekvensering - Nettverksdiagram
•        Et nettverksdiagram, ofte brukt i prosjektledelse, er en grafisk representasjon av prosjektoppgaver og deres avhengigheter. Hoved trins er:
–        Bestem avhengigheter: Definer avhengighetene mellom aktiviteter. Identifiser hvilke oppgaver som må fullføres før andre kan starte. 
–        Bruk de fire typene avhengigheter: Avslutt-til-start (FS), Start-til-Start (SS), Slutt-til-slutt (FF) og Start-til-slutt (SF) etter behov.
–        Opprett noder: Hver oppgave er representert som en node (en boks) i nettverksdiagrammet. Skriv navnet på oppgaven i boksen.
–        Tegn piler: Bruk pilene til å representere oppgaveavhengigheter. Koble nodene med piler som indikerer retningen til avhengigheten. For eksempel representerer en pil som peker fra oppgave A til oppgave B en FS-avhengighet der oppgave A må fullføres før oppgave B kan starte.
–        Legg til varigheter: Inkluder estimert varighet for hver oppgave nær den respektive noden. Dette vil hjelpe deg med å forstå tidslinjen bedre.
•        2. Aktivitetssekvensering
•        Kritisk bane
•        En kritisk vei for et prosjekt er serien av aktiviteter som bestemmer det tidligste tidspunktet da prosjektet kan fullføres.
•        Den kritiske banen er den lengste veien gjennom nettverksdiagrammet og har minst mulig slakk eller flyt.
•        Slakk eller flyte er hvor lang tid en aktivitet kan bli forsinket uten å forsinke en påfølgende aktivitet eller prosjektets sluttdato.
•        Free slack eller free float er hvor lang tid en aktivitet kan bli forsinket uten å forsinke den tidlige starten av umiddelbart etterfølgende aktiviteter.
•        Total slakk eller total flyt er hvor lang tid en aktivitet kan bli forsinket fra tidlig start uten å forsinke den planlagte sluttdatoen for prosjektet.
•        Kritisk bane
•        Analyser nettverksdiagrammet for å identifisere den kritiske banen, som er den lengste sekvensen av 
•        Fordelene med Critical Path Analysis inkluderer:
–        Identifisere de mest tidssensitive aktivitetene
–        Forutsi prosjektvarighet
–        Håndtering av prosjektrisiko
–        Ressursallokering
–        Overvåke fremdrift
•        Et eksempel – Projekt X
•        Kritisk bane
•        Beregn tidlig start (ES) og tidlig målgang (EF): 
–        Start with the first Activity (usually project initiation), which has an ES of 0.
–        Beregn ES og EF for hver påfølgende oppgave basert på den tidligste fullføringstiden for de foregående oppgavene. Formelen er ES = EF fra forgjengeren, og EF = ES + varighet.
•        Beregn sen start (LS) og sen målgang (LF):
–        Begynn med den siste oppgaven i prosjektplanen, sett LF til EF.
–        Beregn LS for hver foregående oppgave basert på siste starttidspunkt for følgende oppgaver. Formelen er LF = LS + varighet
•        Beregn total flyte (slakk):
–        Total Float er hvor lang tid en aktivitet kan bli forsinket uten å forsinke prosjektets fullføring.
–        Total Float beregnes som TF = LS - ES eller LF - EF.
–        Aktiviteter på den kritiske banen har null total flyte (TF = 0)

–        Task 2 (T2): ES = 5, EF = 8
–        Task 3 (T3): ES = 8, EF = 13
–        Task 4 (T4): ES = 13, EF = 20
–        Task 5 (T5): ES = 13, EF = 20
–        Task 6 (T6): ES = 20, EF = 24
–        Task 7 (T7): ES = 20, EF = 23
–        Task 8 (T8): ES = 20, EF = 22
–        Task 9 (T9): ES = 23, EF = 26

•        Gantt Charts
•        Gantt-diagrammer gir et standardformat for visning av prosjektplaninformasjon ved å liste opp prosjektaktiviteter og deres tilsvarende start- og sluttdatoer i et kalenderformat.
•        Elementer i et Gantt-diagram:
–        Aktiviteter: Hver aktivitet i prosjektet representeres som en linje i diagrammet. Aktivitetene er plassert på tidslinjen basert på når de skal starte og slutte.
–        Varighet: Lengden på hver aktivitet vises som en linje som strekker seg over tidslinjen. Dette indikerer hvor lenge hver aktivitet forventes å ta.
–        Start- og sluttdatoer: Gantt-diagrammet inneholder informasjon om når hver aktivitet skal begynne og slutte.
–        Milepæler: Viktige milepæler i prosjektet, som betydningsfulle milestein, er markert i diagrammet for å indikere viktige punkter i prosjektets fremdrift.
–        Avhengigheter: Forholdet mellom ulike aktiviteter, for eksempel start-til-start eller slutt-til-slutt, vises i diagrammet for å vise hvordan aktivitetene er koblet sammen.
•        Gantt Charts - Example



•        Når bruke Ganttchart?
•        For å kommunisere plan eller status for et byggeprosjekt.
•        For å overvåke aktiviteter i et prosjekt.
•        Når du setter sammen et enkelt forslag til et lite prosjekt
•        For å instruere på et høyt nivå sekvensen og varigheten av spesifikke aktiviteter eller prosesser fra et byggeprosjekt,
•        For å demonstrere hvilke aktiviteter som avhenger av fullføring av tidligere aktiviteter.
•        Critical paths as “the sequences of scheduled activities that determines the duration of the project.”



•        Aktivitetsressursestimating
•        1. Top-down estimat: tildeler en samlet tid for prosjektet og deler den deretter ned i diskrete faser, arbeid og oppgaver – vanligvis basert på prosjektets arbeidsnedbrytningsstruktur (WBS)
•        2. Bottom-up-estimat: Ved å bruke denne estimeringsteknikken starter du med å estimere hver enkelt oppgave eller aspekt av prosjektet. Deretter kombinerer du alle disse separate estimatene for å bygge opp det samlede prosjektestimatet. Siden hver aktivitet vurderes individuelt, har denne typen anslag en tendens til å være mer nøyaktig enn ovenfra-ned-tilnærmingen. Men det tar også mer tid.
•        3. Ekspertvurdering: en av de mest populære estimeringsteknikkene, siden dette er rask og enkel. Denne teknikken innebærer å stole på erfaringen til eksperter for å estimere prosjekter. Det er mest nyttig når du planlegger et standardprosjekt som ligner på prosjekter teamet ditt har fullført tidligere. Ekspertvurdering kan brukes til å lage ovenfra-og-ned-estimater.
•        4. Analog estimering: Sammenlignende estimering bruker tidligere prosjektdata kombinert med en top-down tilnærming for å estimere prosjektvarighet. Hvis den gjennomsnittlige gjennomføringstiden for lignende prosjekter var åtte måneder, vil du anta at det nåværende vil ta åtte måneder. Deretter kan du dele opp disse åtte månedene på tvers av oppgaver og aktiviteter for å få arbeidsanslagene på lavere nivå.
•        5. Parametrisk modellestimering: Parametrisk modellering bruker også tidligere prosjektdata, men den prøver å justere dataene for å gjenspeile forskjellene i hvert prosjekt. Denne teknikken tar detaljene fra tidligere prosjekter og pro-raterer den for å estimere det nåværende prosjektet.
•        6. Tre-punkts estimering: I stedet for å anta én varighet for en oppgave, kan du tilordne tre: optimistisk, pessimistisk og mest sannsynlig. Disse tre tallene er gjennomsnittet for å lage ditt faktiske anslag. PERT-metoden (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) bruker tre-punkts estimering, men den tar et vektet gjennomsnitt av de tre poengene, med den "mest sannsynlige" gjetningen som veier mer.
•        PERT Formula and Example
•        PERT weighted average = 

optimistic time + 4X most likely time + pessimistic time
                                6
•        Example:

PERT weighted average =
 8 workdays + 4 X 10 workdays + 24 workdays         = 12 days                                        
                                       6
where: 
optimistic time= 8 days
most likely time = 10 days
pessimistic time = 24 days
    Therefore, you’d use 12 days on the network diagram instead of 10 when using PERT for the above example.
•        Ressursestimering i praksis
•        Andre aktiviteter som haster mye som skal utføres som vil ha prioritet fremfor denne (annet kurs)
•        Ulykker og nødsituasjoner (noen blir syke eller drar)
•        Interne/eksterne møter (teammøter tar tid)
•        Helligdager (Påske?)
•        Kontakt med andre kunder, leverandører og entreprenører (kundekontakt tar tid)
•        Havari i utstyr (døde bærbare datamaskiner?)
•        Avbrudd fra kunder, leverandører, entreprenører, familie, kjæledyr, medarbeidere, etc.
•        Uventede hendelser

•        4. Tidsplankontroll
•        Mål er å kjenne statusen til timeplanen, påvirke faktorer som forårsaker tidsplanendringer, fastslå at tidsplanen har endret seg og administrere endringer når de inntreffer.
•        Verktøy og teknikker inkluderer:
–        Fremdriftsrapporter.
–        Et kontrollsystem for tidsplanendring.
–        Prosjektledelsesprogramvare, inkludert tidsplansammenligningsdiagrammer, for eksempel Gantt-sporingsdiagrammet.
–        Variansanalyse, som å analysere float eller slakk.
–        Ishikawa diagram
•        4. Tidsplankontroll
•        Prosjektlederen overvåker nøye fremdriften av prosjektet for å sikre at oppgaver blir utført i henhold til tidsplanen. Dette kan inkludere daglige eller ukentlige oppdateringer, avhengig av prosjektets varighet og kompleksitet. 
•        Prosjektlederen identifiserer eventuelle avvik mellom den planlagte tidsplanen og den faktiske fremdriften. Dette kan omfatte forsinkelser, tidlig ferdigstillelse eller endringer i oppgaver.
•        Årsaksanalyse: Når avvik oppdages, er det viktig å analysere årsakene. Hvorfor oppstod forsinkelsen? Hva er de underliggende årsakene til avviket? Dette gir grunnlag for å iverksette tiltak.
•        Tiltak og Korreksjoner: Basert på årsaksanalysen, tar prosjektlederen tiltak for å korrigere tidsplanen. Dette kan inkludere omfordeling av ressurser, justering av oppgaver, eller revisjon av tidsplanen.
•        Tidsplankontroll er en kontinuerlig prosess gjennom hele prosjektets livssyklus. Ved å implementere tidsplankontroll riktig, kan prosjektlederen bidra til å sikre at prosjektet leveres til rett tid og innenfor de fastsatte rammene.
•        4. Tidsplankontroll - Eksempel
•        Scenario: Prosjektet har en planlagt leveringsdato for den nye programvareapplikasjonen om 12 uker. Imidlertid har prosjektledelsen oppdaget at prosjektet er forsinket, og det er nå bare 8 uker igjen til den opprinnelige leveringsdatoen.
•        Årsaksanalyse:
•        Manglende ressurser: En gjennomgang av prosjektteamets ressursallokering viser at flere nøkkelressurser har blitt trukket til andre kritiske prosjekter. Dette har ført til redusert bemanning i vårt prosjekt og forsinkelser i oppgaveutførelse.
•        Endringer i krav: Underveis i prosjektet ble det introdusert betydelige endringer i programvarekravene. Dette har ført til omfattende omføkt utviklingsarbeid og har påvirket tidsplanen negativt.
•        Tekniske utfordringer: Under utviklingsprosessen har teamet møtt tekniske utfordringer knyttet til programvarearkitekturen. Løsningene på disse problemene har tatt lengre tid enn forventet.
•        Manglende erfaring: Enkelte teammedlemmer har begrenset erfaring med de nødvendige teknologiene og verktøyene som brukes i prosjektet. Dette har ført til tregere utvikling og testing.
•        Saksavhengigheter: Prosjektoppgaver er i stor grad avhengige av hverandre, og forsinkelser i en oppgave har forplantet seg gjennom tidsplanen, påvirker andre oppgaver
•        4. Tidsplankontroll - Eksempel
•        Tiltak: Basert på årsaksanalysen kan følgende tiltak iverksettes for å takle forsinkelsene og gjenopprette tidsplanen:
•        Ressursallokering: Prosjektledelsen må forhandle med andre prosjekter for å få tilbake nødvendige ressurser og sikre at teamet er tilstrekkelig bemannet.
•        Endringskontroll: Alle nye krav må gå gjennom en streng endringskontrollprosess for å vurdere deres innvirkning på tidsplanen før de blir akseptert.
•        Teknisk støtte: Involvere erfarne tekniske eksperter for å hjelpe med å løse de tekniske utfordringene og forhindre ytterligere forsinkelser.
•        Kompetansebygging: Tilby opplæring og veiledning for teammedlemmer som mangler erfaring med de nødvendige teknologiene.
•        Replanlegging: Gjennomgå og revider tidsplanen for å ta hensyn til avhengigheter og forsinkelser. Identifiser kritiske stier og prioriterte oppgaver.

Many information technology projects are failures in terms of meeting scope, time, and cost
projections. Managers often cite delivering projects on time as one of their biggest challenges
and the main cause of conflict.
Perhaps part of the reason schedule problems are so common is that time is easily
and simply measured. You can debate scope and cost overruns and make actual numbers
appear closer to estimates, but once a project schedule is set, anyone can quickly estimate
schedule performance by subtracting the original time estimate from how long it really
took to complete the project. People often compare planned and actual project completion
times without taking into account approved changes in the project. Time is also the one variable
that has the least amount of flexibility. Time passes no matter what happens on a
project.
Individual work styles and cultural differences may also cause schedule conflicts. You
will learn in Chapter 9, Project Human Resource Management, about the Myers Briggs Type
Indicator. One dimension of this team-building tool deals with peoples attitudes toward
structure and deadlines. Some people prefer detailed schedules and emphasize task completion.
Others prefer to keep things open and flexible. Different cultures and even entire countries
have different attitudes about schedules. For example, some countries close
businesses for several hours every afternoon to have siestas. Others countries may have different
religious or secular holidays at certain times of the year when not much work will
be done. Cultures may also have different perceptions of work ethic some may value hard
work and strict schedules while others may value the ability to remain relaxed and
flexible.

M E D I A S N A P S H O T
In contrast to the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games (see Chapter 4 s Media
Snapshot) or the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, planning and scheduling was not
well implemented for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games held in Athens, Greece. Many
articles were written before the opening ceremonies predicting that the facilities would not
be ready in time. With just 162 days to go to the opening of the Athens Olympics, the
Greek capital is still not ready for the expected onslaught. . . . By now 22 of the 30 Olympic
projects were supposed to be finished. This week the Athens Olympic Committee proudly
announced 19 venues would be finished by the end of next month. That s a long way off
target. 1
However, many people were pleasantly surprised by the amazing opening ceremonies,
beautiful new buildings, and state-of-the-art security and transportation systems in Athens.
For example, traffic flow, considered a major pre-Games hurdle, was superb. One spectator
at the games commented on the prediction that the facilities would not be ready in time,
Athens proved them all wrong. . . . It has never looked better. 2 The Greeks even made fun
of critics by having construction workers pretend to still be working as the ceremonies
began. Athens Olympics chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki deserves a gold medal for her
performance in leading the many people involved in organizing the 2004 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, the Greek government suffered a huge financial deficit since the games cost
more than twice the planned budget.
With all these possibilities for schedule conflicts, it s important to use good project time
management so that project managers can help improve performance in this area. Project
time management, simply defined, involves the processes required to ensure timely completion
of a project. Achieving timely completion of a project, however, is by no means
simple. There are six main processes involved in project time management:
1. Defining activities involves identifying the specific activities that the project
team members and stakeholders must perform to produce the project deliverables.
An activity or task is an element of work normally found on the work
breakdown structure (WBS) that has an expected duration, a cost, and
resource requirements. The main outputs of this process are an activity list,
activity attributes, and milestone list.
2. Sequencing activities involves identifying and documenting the relationships
between project activities. The main outputs of this process include project
schedule network diagrams and project document updates.
3. Estimating activity resources involves estimating how many resources
people, equipment, and materials a project team should use to perform
project activities. The main outputs of this process are activity resource
requirements, a resource breakdown structure, and project document
updates.
4. Estimating activity durations involves estimating the number of work periods
that are needed to complete individual activities. Outputs include activity duration
estimates and project document updates.
213
Project Time Management
5. Developing the schedule involves analyzing activity sequences, activity
resource estimates, and activity duration estimates to create the project schedule.
Outputs include a project schedule, a schedule baseline, schedule data, and
project document updates.
6. Controlling the schedule involves controlling and managing changes to the
project schedule. Outputs include work performance measurements, organizational
process assets updates, change requests, project management plan
updates, and project document updates.
Figure 6-1 summarizes these processes and outputs, showing when they occur in a typical
project.
You can improve project time management by performing these processes and by using
some basic project management tools and techniques. Every manager is familiar with some
form of scheduling, but most managers have not used several of the tools and techniques
unique to project time management, such as Gantt charts, network diagrams, and critical
path analysis.

Project schedules grow out of the basic documents that initiate a project. The project
charter often mentions planned project start and end dates, which serve as the starting
points for a more detailed schedule. The project manager starts with the project charter and

develops a project scope statement and WBS, as discussed in Chapter 5, Project Scope Management.
The project charter should also include some estimate of how much money will
be allocated to the project. Using this information with the main inputs for defining activities
the scope baseline (the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary), enterprise environmental
factors, and organizational process assets the project manager and project
team begin developing a detailed list of activities, their attributes, and a milestone list.
The activity list is a tabulation of activities to be included on a project schedule. The
list should include the activity name, an activity identifier or number, and a brief description
of the activity. The activity attributes provide more schedule-related information about
each activity, such as predecessors, successors, logical relationships, leads and lags,
resource requirements, constraints, imposed dates, and assumptions related to the activity.
The activity list and activity attributes should be in agreement with the WBS and WBS dictionary.
Information is added to the activity attributes as it becomes available, such as logical
relationships and resource requirements that are determined in later processes. Many
project teams use an automated system to keep track of all of this activity-related
information.
A milestone on a project is a significant event that normally has no duration. It often
takes several activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone, but the milestone itself
is like a marker to help in identifying necessary activities. Milestones are also useful tools for
setting schedule goals and monitoring progress. For example, milestones on a project like
the one in the opening case might include completion and customer sign-off of documents,
such as design documents and test plans; completion of specific products, such as software
modules or installation of new hardware; and completion of important process-related work,
such as project review meetings, tests, and so on. Not every deliverable or output created for
a project is really a milestone. Milestones are the most important and visible ones. For
example, the term milestone is used in several contexts, such as in child development.
Parents and doctors check for milestones, such as a child first rolling over, sitting, crawling,
walking, talking, and so on. You will learn more about milestones later in this chapter.
Activity information is a required input to the other time management processes. You
cannot determine activity sequencing, resources, or durations, develop the schedule, or
control the schedule until you have a good understanding of project activities.
Recall the triple constraint of project management balancing scope, time, and cost
goals and note the order of these items. Ideally, the project team and key stakeholders first
define the project scope, then the time or schedule for the project, and then the project s
cost. The order of these three items reflects the basic order of the first four processes in
project time management: defining activities (further defining the scope), sequencing activities
(further defining the time), and estimating activity resources and activity durations (further
defining the time and cost). These four project time management processes are the
basis for creating a project schedule.
The goal of the defining activities is to ensure that the project team has complete understanding
of all the work they must do as part of the project scope so they can start scheduling
the work. For example, a WBS item might be Produce study report. The project
team would have to understand what that means before they can make schedule-related
decisions. How long should the report be? Does it require a survey or extensive research
to produce it? What skill level does the report writer need to have? Further defining that
task will help the project team determine how long it will take to do and who should do it.
215
Project Time Management
The WBS is often dissected further as the project team members further define the
activities required for performing the work. For example, the task Produce study report
might be broken down into several subtasks describing the steps involved in producing the
report, such as developing a survey, administering the survey, analyzing the survey results,
performing research, writing a draft report, editing the report, and finally producing the
report. This process of progressive elaboration, as mentioned as an attribute of a project in
Chapter 1, is sometimes called rolling wave planning.
As stated earlier, activities or tasks are elements of work performed during the course
of a project; they have expected durations, costs, and resource requirements. Defining activities
also results in supporting detail to document important product information as well as
assumptions and constraints related to specific activities. The project team should review
the activity list and activity attributes with project stakeholders before moving on to the
next step in project time management. If they do not review these items, they could produce
an unrealistic schedule and deliver unacceptable results. For example, if a project manager
simply estimated that it would take one day for the Produce study report task and had
an intern or trainee write a 10-page report to complete that task, the result could be a furious
customer who expected extensive research, surveys, and a 100-page report. Clearly
defining the work is crucial to all projects. If there are misunderstandings about activities,
requested changes may be required.
In the opening case, Sue Johnson and her project team had a contract and detailed specifications
for the college s new online registration system. They also had to focus on meeting
the May 1 date for an operational system so the college could start using the new
system for the new semester s registration. To develop a project schedule, Sue and her team
had to review the contract, detailed specifications, and desired operational date, create an
activity list, activity attributes, and milestone list. After developing more detailed definitions
of project activities, Sue and her team would review them with their customers to ensure
that they were on the right track.

At the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), poor time management was one of the
reasons behind the failure of Trilogy, a disastrous, unbelievably expensive piece of vaporware,
which was more than four years in the (un)making. The system was supposed to
enable FBI agents to integrate intelligence from isolated information silos within the
Bureau. 3 In May 2006, the Government Accounting Agency said that the Trilogy project
failed at its core mission of improving the FBI s investigative abilities and was plagued with
missed milestones and escalating costs.
The FBI rushed to develop the new system, beginning in 2001, in response to the
attacks on September 11. The need for new software was obvious to former FBI agent,
David J. Williams, who recalls joining a roomful of agents shortly after 9/11 to help with
intelligence. Agents were wearing out the casters on their chairs by sliding back and forth
between 20 old computer terminals, many of which were attached to various databases containing
different information.

Congressional hearings revealed numerous problems with the project. The requirements
for the project were very loosely defined, there were many leadership changes
throughout the project, and several contracts had no scheduled milestones for completion
or penalties if work was late. The new system was finally completed in 2006 and cost more
than $537 million more than a year late and $200 million over budget. The FBI replaced
Trilogy with a new system called Sentinel and began training employees to use it in May
2007. Although that was about a month behind schedule, director Robert Mueller told a
Senate panel that he was optimistic about the $425 million project s progress.4

After defining project activities, the next step in project time management is sequencing
them or determining their dependencies. Inputs to the activity sequencing process include
the activity list and attributes, project scope statement, milestone list, and organizational
process assets. It involves evaluating the reasons for dependencies and the different types
of dependencies.
Dependencies
A dependency or relationship relates to the sequencing of project activities or tasks. For
example, does a certain activity have to be finished before another one can start? Can the
project team do several activities in parallel? Can some overlap? Determining these relationships
or dependencies between activities has a significant impact on developing and
managing a project schedule.
There are three basic reasons for creating dependencies among project activities:
Mandatory dependencies are inherent in the nature of the work being performed
on a project. They are sometimes referred to as hard logic. For example,
you cannot test code until after the code is written.
Discretionary dependencies are defined by the project team. For example, a
project team might follow good practice and not start the detailed design of a
new information system until the users sign off on all of the analysis work. Discretionary
dependencies are sometimes referred to as soft logic and should be
used with care since they may limit later scheduling options.
External dependencies involve relationships between project and non-project
activities. The installation of a new operating system and other software may
depend on delivery of new hardware from an external supplier. Even though
the delivery of the new hardware may not be in the scope of the project, you
should add an external dependency to it because late delivery will affect the
project schedule.
As with activity definition, it is important that project stakeholders work together to
define the activity dependencies that exist on their project. If you do not define the
sequence of activities, you cannot use some of the most powerful schedule tools available
to project managers: network diagrams and critical path analysis.
217
Project Time Management
Network Diagrams
Network diagrams are the preferred technique for showing activity sequencing. A network
diagram is a schematic display of the logical relationships among, or sequencing of, project
activities. Some people refer to network diagrams as project schedule network diagrams or
PERT charts. PERT is described later in this chapter. Figure 6-2 shows a sample network
diagram for Project X, which uses the arrow diagramming method (ADM) or activity-onarrow
(AOA) approach.
Note the main elements on this network diagram. The letters A through J represent
activities with dependencies that are required to complete the project. These activities
come from the WBS and activity definition process described earlier. The arrows represent
the activity sequencing or relationships between tasks. For example, Activity A must be
done before Activity D; Activity D must be done before Activity H, and so on.
The format of this network diagram uses the activity-on-arrow (AOA) approach or the
arrow diagramming method (ADM) a network diagramming technique in which activities
are represented by arrows and connected at points called nodes to illustrate the
sequence of activities. A node is simply the starting and ending point of an activity. The
first node signifies the start of a project, and the last node represents the end of a
project.
Keep in mind that the network diagram represents activities that must be done to complete
the project. It is not a race to get from the first node to the last node. Every activity
on the network diagram must be completed in order for the project to finish. It is also
important to note that not every single item on the WBS needs to be on the network
diagram; only activities with dependencies need to be shown on the network diagram. However,
some people like to have start and end milestones and to list every activity. It is a matter
of preference. For projects with hundreds of activities, it might be simpler to include
only activities with dependencies on a network diagram, especially on large projects. Sometimes
it is enough to put summary tasks on a network diagram or to break down the project
into several smaller network diagrams.
Note: Assume all durations are in days; A=1 means Activity A has a
duration of 1 day.

Chapter 6
Assuming you have a list of the project activities and their start and finish nodes, follow
these steps to create an AOA network diagram:
1. Find all of the activities that start at Node 1. Draw their finish nodes, and draw
arrows between Node 1 and each of those finish nodes. Put the activity letter
or name on the associated arrow. If you have a duration estimate, write that
next to the activity letter or name, as shown in Figure 6-2. For example, A = 1
means that the duration of Activity A is one day, week, or other standard unit
of time. Also be sure to put arrowheads on all arrows to signify the direction
of the relationships.
2. Continue drawing the network diagram, working from left to right. Look for
bursts and merges. Bursts occur when two or more activities follow a single
node. A merge occurs when two or more nodes precede a single node. For
example, in Figure 6-2, Node 1 is a burst since it goes into Nodes 2, 3, and 4.
Node 5 is a merge preceded by Nodes 2 and 3.
3. Continue drawing the AOA network diagram until all activities are included
on the diagram.
4. As a rule of thumb, all arrowheads should face toward the right, and no arrows
should cross on an AOA network diagram. You may need to redraw the diagram
to make it look presentable.
Even though AOA or ADM network diagrams are generally easy to understand and create,
a different method is more commonly used: the precedence diagramming method. The
precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a network diagramming technique in which
boxes represent activities. It is particularly useful for visualizing certain types of time
relationships.
Figure 6-3 illustrates the types of dependencies that can occur among project activities.
After you determine the reason for a dependency between activities (mandatory,
FIGURE 6-3 Task dependency types
219
Project Time Management
discretionary, or external), you must determine the type of dependency. Note that the terms
activity and task are used interchangeably, as are relationship and dependency. See
Appendix A to learn how to create dependencies in Microsoft Project 2007. The four types
of dependencies or relationships between activities include:
Finish-to-start dependency: a relationship where the from activity or predecessor
must finish before the to activity or successor can start. For example,
you cannot provide user training until after software, or a new system, has been
installed. Finish-to-start is the most common type of relationship, or dependency,
and AOA network diagrams use only finish-to-start dependencies.
Start-to-start dependency: a relationship in which the from activity cannot
start until the to activity or successor is started. For example, on several
information technology projects, a group of activities all start simultaneously,
such as the many tasks that occur when a new system goes live.
Finish-to-finish dependency: a relationship where the from activity must
be finished before the to activity can be finished. One task cannot finish
before another finishes. For example, quality control efforts cannot finish
before production finishes, although the two activities can be performed at the
same time.
Start-to-finish dependency: a relationship where the from activity must start
before the to activity can be finished. This type of relationship is rarely used,
but it is appropriate in some cases. For example, an organization might strive
to stock raw materials just in time for the manufacturing process to begin. A
delay in the manufacturing process starting should delay completion of stocking
the raw materials. Another example would be a babysitter who wants to finish
watching a young child but is dependent on the parent arriving. The parent must
show up or start before the babysitter can finish his or her oversight.
Figure 6-4 illustrates Project X using the precedence diagramming method. Notice that
the activities are placed inside boxes, which represent the nodes on this diagram. Arrows
show the relationships between activities. This figure was created using Microsoft Project,
which automatically places additional information inside each node. Each task box includes
the start and finish date, labeled Start and Finish, the task ID number, labeled ID, the task s
duration, labeled Dur, and the names of resources, if any, assigned to the task, labeled Res.
The border of the boxes for tasks on the critical path appears automatically in red in the
Microsoft Project network diagram view. In Figure 6-4, the boxes for critical tasks have a
thicker border.
The precedence diagramming method is used more often than AOA network diagrams
and offers a number of advantages over the AOA technique. First, most project management
software uses the precedence diagramming method. Second, the precedence
diagramming method avoids the need to use dummy activities. Dummy activities have
no duration and no resources but are occasionally needed on AOA network diagrams to
show logical relationships between activities. They are represented with dashed arrow
lines, and have zero for the duration estimate. Third, the precedence diagramming method
shows different dependencies among tasks, whereas AOA network diagrams use only
finish-to-start dependencies. You will learn more about activity sequencing using Project
2007 in Appendix A.

Chapter 6
E S T I M A T I N G A C T I V I T Y R E S O U R C E S
Before you can estimate the duration for each activity, you must have a good idea of the
quantity and type of resources (people, equipment, and materials) that will be assigned to
each activity. The nature of the project and the organization will affect resource estimating.
Expert judgment, an analysis of alternatives, estimating data, and project management software
are tools available to assist in resource estimating. It is important that the people who
help determine what resources are necessary include people who have experience and
expertise in similar projects and with the organization performing the project.
Important questions to answer in activity resource estimating include:
How difficult will it be to do specific activities on this project?
Is there anything unique in the project s scope statement that will affect
resources?
What is the organization s history in doing similar activities? Has the organization
done similar tasks before? What level of personnel did the work?
Does the organization have people, equipment, and materials that are capable
and available for performing the work? Are there any organizational policies
that might affect the availability of resources?
Does the organization need to acquire more resources to accomplish the
work? Would it make sense to outsource some of the work? Will outsourcing
increase or decrease the amount of resources needed and when they ll be
available?
A project s activity list, activity attributes, resource calendars or availability, enterprise
environmental factors, and organizational process assets (such as policies regarding staffing
FIGURE 6-4 Precedence diagramming method (PDM) network diagram for Project X
221
Project Time Management
and outsourcing) are all important inputs to answering these questions. During the early
phases of a project, the project team may not know which specific people, equipment, and
materials will be available. For example, they might know from past projects that there will
be a mix of experienced and inexperienced programmers working on a project. They might
also have information available that approximates the number of people or hours it normally
takes to perform specific activities.
It is important to thoroughly brainstorm and evaluate alternatives related to
resources, especially on projects that involve people from multiple disciplines and companies.
Since most projects involve many human resources and the majority of costs
are for salaries and benefits, it is often effective to solicit ideas from different people
to help develop alternatives and address resource-related issues early in a project. The
resource estimates should also be updated as more detailed information becomes
available.
The main outputs of the resource estimating process include a list of activity
resource requirements, a resource breakdown structure, and project document updates.
For example, if junior employees will be assigned to many activities, the project manager
might request that additional activities, time, and resources be approved to help train and
mentor those employees. In addition to providing the basis for estimating activity durations,
estimating activity resources provides vital information for project cost estimating
(Chapter 7), project human resource management (Chapter 9), project communications
management (Chapter 10), project risk management (Chapter 11), and project procurement
management (Chapter 12). For example, a resource breakdown structure is a
hierarchical structure that identifies the project s resources by category and type.
Resource categories might include analysts, programmers, and testers. Under programmers,
there might be types of programmers, such as Java programmers or COBOL programmers.
This information would be helpful in determining resource costs, acquiring
resources, and so on.
E S T I M A T I N G A C T I V I T Y D U R A T I O N S
After working with key stakeholders to define activities, determine their dependencies, and
estimate their resources, the next process in project time management is to estimate the
duration of activities. It is important to note that duration includes the actual amount of
time worked on an activity plus elapsed time. For example, even though it might take one
workweek or five workdays to do the actual work, the duration estimate might be two weeks
to allow extra time needed to obtain outside information. The resources assigned to a task
will also affect the task duration estimate.
Do not confuse duration with effort, which is the number of workdays or work hours
required to complete a task. A duration estimate of one day could be based on eight hours
of work or eighty hours of work. Duration relates to the time estimate, not the effort estimate.
Of course, the two are related, so project team members must document their
assumptions when creating duration estimates and update the estimates as the project progresses.
The people who will actually do the work, in particular, should have a lot of say in
these duration estimates, since they are the ones whose performance will be evaluated on
meeting them. If scope changes occur on the project, the duration estimates should be
222
Chapter 6
updated to reflect those changes. It is also helpful to review similar projects and seek the
advice of experts in estimating activity durations.
There are several inputs to activity duration estimating. The activity list, activity attributes,
activity resource requirements, resource calendars, project scope statement, enterprise environmental
factors, and organizational process assets all include information that affect duration
estimates. In addition to reviewing past project information, the teamshould also review the
accuracy of the duration estimates thus far on the project. For example, if they find that all of
their estimates have beenmuch too long or short, the teamshould update the estimates to
reflect what they have learned. One of themost important considerations inmaking activity
duration estimates is the availability of resources, especially human resources.What specific
skills do people need to do the work?What are the skill levels of the people assigned to the project?
Howmany people are expected to be available to work on the project at any one time?
The outputs of activity duration estimating include activity duration estimates and
project document updates. Duration estimates are often provided as a discrete number, such
as four weeks, or as a range, such as three to five weeks, or as a three-point estimate. A
three-point estimate is an estimate that includes an optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic
estimate, such as three weeks for the optimistic, four weeks for the most likely, and five weeks
for the pessimistic estimate. The optimistic estimate is based on a best-case scenario, while
the pessimistic estimate is based on a worst-case scenario. The most likely estimate, as it
sounds, is an estimate based on a most likely or expected scenario. A three-point estimate is
required for performing PERT estimates, as described later in this chapter, and for performing
Monte Carlo simulations, described in Chapter 11, Project Risk Management. Other duration
estimating techniques include analogous and parametric estimating and reserve analysis, as
described in Chapter 7, Project Cost Management. Expert judgment is also an important tool
for developing good activity duration estimates.

Schedule development uses the results of all the preceding project time management processes
to determine the start and end dates of the project. There are often several iterations
of all the project time management processes before a project schedule is finalized. The ultimate
goal of developing the schedule is to create a realistic project schedule that provides
a basis for monitoring project progress for the time dimension of the project. The main outputs
of this process are the project schedule, a schedule baseline, project document
updates, and schedule data. Some project teams create a computerized model to create a
network diagram, enter resource requirements and availability by time period, and adjust
other information to quickly generate alternative schedules. See Appendix A for information
on using Project 2007 to assist in schedule development.
Several tools and techniques assist in schedule development:
A Gantt chart is a common tool for displaying project schedule information.
Critical path analysis is a very important tool for developing and controlling
project schedules.
Critical chain scheduling is a technique that focuses on limited resources when
creating a project schedule.
PERT analysis is a means for considering schedule risk on projects.
223
Project Time Management
The following sections provide samples of each of these tools and techniques and discuss
their advantages and disadvantages. (See the PMBOK® Guide, Fourth Edition to learn
how these main techniques and others are broken into additional categories.)
Gantt Charts
Gantt charts provide a standard format for displaying project schedule information by listing
project activities and their corresponding start and finish dates in a calendar format. Gantt
charts are sometimes referred to as bar charts since the activities start and end dates are
shown as horizontal bars. Figure 6-5 shows a simple Gantt chart for Project X created with
Microsoft Project. Figure 6-6 shows a Gantt chart that is more sophisticated based on a software
launch project from a template provided by Microsoft. Recall that the activities on the
Gantt chart should coincide with the activities on the WBS, which should coincide with the
activity list and milestone list. Notice that the software launch project s Gantt chart contains
milestones, summary tasks, individual task durations, and arrows showing task dependencies.
Notice the different symbols on the software launch project s Gantt chart (Figure 6-6):
The black diamond symbol represents a milestone. In Figure 6-6, Task 1, Marketing
Plan distributed, is a milestone that occurs on March 17. Tasks 3, 4,
8, 9, 14, 25, 27, 43, and 45 are also milestones. For very large projects, top
managers might want to see only milestones on a Gantt chart. Microsoft Project
allows you to filter information displayed on a Gantt chart so you can easily
show specific tasks, such as milestones.
The thick black bars with arrows at the beginning and end represent summary
tasks. For example, Activities 12 through 15 Develop creative briefs,
Develop concepts, Creative concepts, and Ad development are all subtasks
of the summary task called Advertising, Task 11. WBS activities are
referred to as tasks and subtasks in most project management software.
FIGURE 6-5 Gantt chart for Project X
224
Chapter 6
The light gray horizontal bars such as those found in Figure 6-6 for Tasks 5,
6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 22, 24, 26, and 44, represent the duration of each individual
task. For example, the light gray bar for Subtask 5, Packaging, starts in
mid-February and extends until early May.
Arrows connecting these symbols show relationships or dependencies between
tasks. Gantt charts often do not show dependencies, which is their major disadvantage.
If dependencies have been established in Microsoft Project, they are
automatically displayed on the Gantt chart.
Adding Milestones to Gantt Charts
Milestones can be a particularly important part of schedules, especially for large projects.
Many people like to focus on meeting milestones, so you can create milestones to emphasize
important events or accomplishments on projects. Normally, you create milestones by
entering tasks with zero duration. In Microsoft Project, you can also mark any task as a
milestone by checking the appropriate box in the Advanced tab of the Task Information dialog
box. The duration of the task will not change to zero, but the Gantt chart will show the
milestone symbol to represent that task based on its start date. See Appendix A for more
information.

To make milestones meaningful, some people use the SMART criteria to help define
them. The SMART criteria are guidelines suggesting that milestones should be:
Specific
Measurable
Assignable
Realistic
Time-framed
For example, distributing a marketing plan is specific, measurable, and assignable if
everyone knows what should be in the marketing plan, how it should be distributed, how
many copies should be distributed and to whom, and who is responsible for the actual delivery.
Distributing the marketing plan is realistic and able to be time-framed if it is an achievable
event and scheduled at an appropriate time.
B E S T P R A C T I C E
Schedule risk is inherent in the development of complex systems. Luc Richard, the founder
of www.projectmangler.com, suggests that project managers can reduce schedule risk
through project milestones, a best practice that involves identifying and tracking significant
points or achievements in the project. The five key points of using project milestones
include the following:
1. Define milestones early in the project and include them in the Gantt chart to provide
a visual guide.
2. Keep milestones small and frequent.
3. The set of milestones must be all-encompassing.
4. Each milestone must be binary, meaning it is either complete or incomplete.
5. Carefully monitor the critical path.
Additional best practices Richard recommends for software development projects
include the following:
Monitor the project s progress and revise the plan.
Build on a solid base; that means developing a system with less than a .1 percent
defect rate.
Assign the right people to the right tasks. Put the best developers on the critical tasks.
Start with high-risk tasks.
Don t boil the ocean. In other words, if the entire project consists of high-risk
tasks, then the project itself is high-risk and bound for failure.
Integrate early and often, and follow practices like the daily build process.5 (A
daily build involves compiling the latest version of a software program each day
to ensure that all required dependencies are present and that the program is tested
to avoid introducing new bugs.)
Using Tracking Gantt Charts to Compare Planned and Actual Dates
You can use a special form of a Gantt chart to evaluate progress on a project by showing
actual schedule information. Figure 6-7 shows a Tracking Gantt chart a Gantt chart that
226
Chapter 6
compares planned and actual project schedule information. The planned schedule dates for
activities are called the baseline dates, and the entire approved planned schedule is called
the schedule baseline. The Tracking Gantt chart includes columns (hidden in Figure 6-7)
labeled Start and Finish to represent actual start and finish dates for each task, as well
as columns labeled Baseline Start and Baseline Finish to represent planned start and finish
dates for each task. In this example, the project is completed, but several tasks missed
their planned start and finish dates.
To serve as a progress evaluation tool, a Tracking Gantt chart uses a few additional
symbols:
Notice that the Gantt chart in Figure 6-7 often shows two horizontal bars for tasks.
The top horizontal bar represents the planned or baseline duration for each task.
The bar below it represents the actual duration. Subtasks 1.2 and 1.3 illustrate this
type of display. If these two bars are the same length, and start and end on the
same dates, then the actual schedule was the same as the planned schedule for
that task. This scheduling occurred for Subtask 1.1, where the task started and
ended as planned on March 4. If the bars do not start and end on the same dates,
then the actual schedule differed from the planned or baseline schedule. If the top
horizontal bar is shorter than the bottom one, the task took longer than planned,
as you can see for Subtask 1.2. If the top horizontal bar is longer than the bottom
one, the task took less time than planned. A striped horizontal bar, illustrated by
Main Tasks 1 and 2, represents the planned duration for summary tasks. The
black bar adjoining it shows progress for summary tasks. For example, Main Task
2 clearly shows the actual duration took longer than what was planned.
A white diamond on the Tracking Gantt chart represents a slipped milestone.
A slipped milestone means the milestone activity was actually completed later
than originally planned. For example, the last task provides an example of a
Planned dates
Actual dates Slipped milestone
FIGURE 6-7 Sample Tracking Gantt chart
227
Project Time Management
slipped milestone since the final report and presentation were completed later
than planned.
Percentages to the right of the horizontal bars display the percentage of work
completed for each task. For example, 100 percent means the task is finished,
50 percent means the task is still in progress and is 50 percent completed.
A Tracking Gantt chart is based on the percentage of work completed for project tasks
or the actual start and finish dates. It allows the project manager to monitor schedule progress
on individual tasks and the whole project. For example, Figure 6-7 shows that this project
is completed. It started on time, but it finished a little late, on May 13 (5/13) versus May 8.
The main advantage of using Gantt charts is that they provide a standard format for displaying
planned and actual project schedule information. In addition, they are easy to create
and understand. The main disadvantage of Gantt charts is that they do not usually show relationships
or dependencies between tasks. If Gantt charts are created using project management
software and tasks are linked, then the dependencies will be displayed, but differently
than they would be displayed on a network diagram. However, whether you prefer viewing
dependencies on a Gantt chart or network diagram is a matter of personal preference.
Critical Path Method
Many projects fail to meet schedule expectations. Critical path method (CPM) also called
critical path analysis is a network diagramming technique used to predict total project
duration. This important tool will help you combat project schedule overruns. A critical path
for a project is the series of activities that determine the earliest time by which the project can
be completed. It is the longest path through the network diagram and has the least amount
of slack or float. Slack or float is the amount of time an activity may be delayed without delaying
a succeeding activity or the project finish date. There are normally several tasks done in
parallel on projects, and most projects have multiple paths through a network diagram. The
longest path or path containing the critical tasks is what is driving the completion date for the
project. You are not finished with the project until you have finished all the tasks.
Calculating the Critical Path
To find the critical path for a project, you must first develop a good network diagram, which,
in turn, requires a good activity list based on the WBS. Once you create a network diagram,
you must also estimate the duration of each activity to determine the critical path. Calculating
the critical path involves adding the durations for all activities on each path through the
network diagram. The longest path is the critical path.
Figure 6-8 shows the AOA network diagram for Project X again. Note that you can use
either the AOA or precedence diagramming method to determine the critical path on projects.
Figure 6-8 shows all of the paths a total of four through the network diagram. Note
that each path starts at the first node (1) and ends at the last node (8) on the AOA network
diagram. This figure also shows the length or total duration of each path through the network
diagram. These lengths are computed by adding the durations of each activity on the path.
Since path B-E-H-J at 16 days has the longest duration, it is the critical path for the project.
What does the critical path really mean? The critical path shows the shortest time in
which a project can be completed. Even though the critical path is the longest path, it
228
Chapter 6
represents the shortest time it takes to complete a project. If one or more of the activities
on the critical path takes longer than planned, the whole project schedule will slip unless
the project manager takes corrective action.
Project teams can be creative in managing the critical path. For example, Joan Knutson,
a well-known author and speaker in the project management field, often describes how a
gorilla helped Apple computer complete a project on time. Team members worked in an
area with cubicles, and whoever was in charge of a task currently on the critical path had
a big, stuffed gorilla on top of his or her cubicle. Everyone knew that person was under the
most time pressure, so they tried not to distract him or her. When a critical task was completed,
the person in charge of the next critical task received the gorilla.
Growing Grass Can Be on the Critical Path
People are often confused about what the critical path is for a project or what it really
means. Some people think the critical path includes the most critical activities. However,
the critical path is concerned only with the time dimension of a project. The fact that its
name includes the word critical does not mean that it includes all critical activities. For
example, Frank Addeman, Executive Project Director at Walt Disney Imagineering,
explained in a keynote address at a PMI-ISSIG Professional Development Seminar that growing
grass was on the critical path for building Disney s Animal Kingdom theme park! This
500-acre park required special grass for its animal inhabitants, and some of the grass took
years to grow. Another misconception is that the critical path is the shortest path through
the network diagram. In some areas, such as transportation modeling, similar network diagrams
are drawn in which identifying the shortest path is the goal. For a project, however,
each task or activity must be done in order to complete the project. It is not a matter of
choosing the shortest path.

Project Time Management
Other aspects of critical path analysis may cause confusion. Can there be more
than one critical path on a project? Does the critical path ever change? In the Project
X example, suppose that Activity A has a duration estimate of three days instead of one
day. This new duration estimate would make the length of Path 1 equal to 16 days. Now
the project has two longest paths of equal duration, so there are two critical paths.
Therefore, there can be more than one critical path on a project. Project managers
should closely monitor performance of activities on the critical path to avoid late project
completion. If there is more than one critical path, project managers must keep
their eyes on all of them.
The critical path on a project can change as the project progresses. For example, suppose
everything is going as planned at the beginning of the project. In this example, suppose Activities
A, B, C, D, E, F, and G all start and finish as planned. Then suppose Activity I runs into problems.
If Activity I takes more than four days, it will cause path C-G-I-J to be longer than the
other paths, assuming they progress as planned. This change would cause path
C-G-I-J to become the new critical path. Therefore, the critical path can change on a project.
Using Critical Path Analysis to Make Schedule Trade-Offs
It is important to know what the critical path is throughout the life of a project so the product
manager can make trade-offs. If the project manager knows that one of the tasks on the
critical path is behind schedule, he or she needs to decide what to do about it. Should the
schedule be renegotiated with stakeholders? Should more resources be allocated to other
items on the critical path to make up for that time? Is it okay if the project finishes behind
schedule? By keeping track of the critical path, the project manager and his or her team
take a proactive role in managing the project schedule.
A technique that can help project managers make schedule trade-offs is determining the
free slack and total slack for each project activity. Free slack or free float is the amount
of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any immediately
following activities. The early start date for an activity is the earliest possible time an
activity can start based on the project network logic. Total slack or total float is the amount
of time an activity can be delayed from its early start without delaying the planned project
finish date.
Project managers calculate free slack and total slack by doing a forward and backward
pass through a network diagram. A forward pass determines the early start and early finish
dates for each activity. The early finish date for an activity is the earliest possible time an
activity can finish based on the project network logic. The project start date is equal to the
early start date for the first network diagram activity. Early start plus the duration of the
first activity is equal to the early finish date of the first activity. It is also equal to the early
start date of each subsequent activity unless an activity has multiple predecessors. When
an activity has multiple predecessors, its early start date is the latest of the early finish
datesof those predecessors. For example, Tasks D and E immediately precede Task H in
Figure 6-8. The early start date for Task H, therefore, is the early finish date of Task E, since
it occurs later than the early finish date of Task D. A backward pass through the network
diagram determines the late start and late finish dates for each activity in a similar fashion.
The late start date for an activity is the latest possible time an activity might begin without
delaying the project finish date. The late finish date for an activity is the latest possible
time an activity can be completed without delaying the project finish date.
230
Chapter 6
Project managers can determine the early and late start and finish dates of each activity
by hand. For example, Figure 6-9 shows a simple network diagram with three tasks, A, B,
and C. Tasks A and B both precede Task C. Assume all duration estimates are in days. Task
A has an estimated duration of 5 days, Task B has an estimated duration of 10 days, and
Task C has an estimated duration of 7 days. There are only two paths through this small network
diagram: path A-C has a duration of 12 days (5 7), and path B-C has a duration of
17 days (10 7). Since path B-C is longest, it is the critical path. There is no float or slack
on this path, so the early and late start and finish dates are the same. However, Task A has
5 days of float or slack. Its early start date is day 0, and its late start date is day 5. Its early
finish date is day 5, and its late finish date is day 10. Both the free and total float amounts
for Task A are the same at 5 days.
A much faster and easier way to determine early and late start and finish dates and free
and total slack amounts for activities is by using project management software. Table 6-1
shows the free and total slack for all activities on the network diagram for Project X after
entering the data from Figure 6-8 and assuming Tasks A, B, and C started on August 3,
2009. (The network diagram is shown in Figure 6-4.) The data in this table was created
by selecting the Schedule Table view in Microsoft Project. Knowing the amount of float or
slack allows project managers to know whether the schedule is flexible and how flexible it
might be. For example, at 7 days (7d), Task F has the most free and total slack. The most
slack on any other activity is only 2 days (2d). Understanding how to create and use slack
information provides a basis for negotiating (or not negotiating) project schedules. See the
Help information in Microsoft Project or research other resources for more detailed information
on calculating slack.

Project Time Management
Using the Critical Path to Shorten a Project Schedule
It is common for stakeholders to want to shorten a project schedule estimate. A project
team may have done their best to develop a project schedule by defining activities, determining
sequencing, and estimating resources and durations for each activity. The results
of this work may have shown that the project team needs ten months to complete the project.
The sponsor might ask if the project can be done in eight or nine months. Rarely do
people ask the project team to take longer than they suggested. By knowing the critical path,
the project manager and his or her team can use several duration compression techniques
to shorten the project schedule. One technique is to reduce the duration of activities on the
critical path. The project manager can shorten the duration of critical path activities by allocating
more resources to those activities or by changing their scope.
Recall that Sue Johnson in the opening case was having schedule problems with the
online registration project because several users missed important project review meetings
and one of the senior programmers quit. If Sue and her team created a realistic project
schedule, produced accurate duration estimates, and established dependencies between
tasks, they could analyze their status in terms of meeting the May 1 deadline. If some activities
on the critical path had already slipped and they did not build in extra time at the end
of the project, then they would have to take corrective actions to finish the project on time.
Sue could request that her company or the college provide more people to work on the project
in an effort to make up time. She could also request that the scope of activities be
reduced to complete the project on time. Sue could also use project time management techniques,
such as crashing or fast tracking, to shorten the project schedule.

Chapter 6
Crashing is a technique for making cost and schedule trade-offs to obtain the greatest
amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost. For example, suppose one
of the items on the critical path for the online registration project was entering course data
for the new semester into the new system. If this task is yet to be done and was originally
estimated to take two weeks based on the college providing one part-time data entry clerk,
Sue could suggest that the college have the clerk work full time to finish the task in one
week instead of two. This change would not cost Sue s company more money, and it could
shorten the project end date by one week. If the college could not meet this request, Sue
could consider hiring a temporary data entry person for one week to help get the task done
faster. By focusing on tasks on the critical path that could be done more quickly for no extra
cost or a small cost, the project schedule can be shortened.
The main advantage of crashing is shortening the time it takes to finish a project. The
main disadvantage of crashing is that it often increases total project costs. You will learn
more about project costs in Chapter 7, Project Cost Management.
Another technique for shortening a project schedule is fast tracking. Fast tracking
involves doing activities in parallel that you would normally do in sequence. For example,
Sue Johnson s project team may have planned not to start any of the coding for the online
registration system until all of the analysis was done. Instead, they could consider starting
some coding activity before the analysis is completed. The main advantage of fast tracking,
like crashing, is that it can shorten the time it takes to finish a project. The main disadvantage
of fast tracking is that it can end up lengthening the project schedule since starting
some tasks too soon often increases project risk and results in rework.
Importance of Updating Critical Path Data
In addition to finding the critical path at the beginning of a project, it is important to update
the schedule with actual data. After the project team completes activities, the project manager
should document the actual durations of those activities. He or she should also document
revised estimates for activities in progress or yet to be started. These revisions often
cause a project s critical path to change, resulting in a new estimated completion date for
the project. Again, proactive project managers and their teams stay on top of changes so
they can make informed decisions and keep stakeholders informed of, and involved in,
major project decisions.
Critical Chain Scheduling
Another technique that addresses the challenge of meeting or beating project finish dates
is an application of the Theory of Constraints called critical chain scheduling. The Theory
of Constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt and
discussed in his books The Goal and Critical Chain. The Theory of Constraints is based
on the fact that, like a chain with its weakest link, any complex system at any point in time
often has only one aspect or constraint that limits its ability to achieve more of its goal. For
the system to attain any significant improvements, that constraint must be identified, and
the whole system must be managed with it in mind. Critical chain scheduling is a method
of scheduling that considers limited resources when creating a project schedule and
includes buffers to protect the project completion date.
An important concept in critical chain scheduling is the availability of scarce resources.
Some projects cannot be done unless a particular resource is available to work on one or
233
Project Time Management
several tasks. For example, if a television station wants to produce a show centered around
a particular celebrity, it must first check the availability of that celebrity. As another example,
if a particular piece of equipment is needed full time to complete each of two tasks that
were originally planned to occur simultaneously, critical chain scheduling acknowledges
that you must either delay one of those tasks until the equipment is available or find another
piece of equipment in order to meet the schedule. Other important concepts related to critical
chain scheduling include multitasking and time buffers.
Multitasking occurs when a resource works on more than one task at a time. This situation
occurs frequently on projects. People are assigned to multiple tasks within the same
project or different tasks on multiple projects. For example, suppose someone is working
on three different tasks, Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, for three different projects, and each
task takes 10 days to complete. If the person did not multitask, and instead completed each
task sequentially, starting with Task 1, then Task 1 would be completed after day 10, Task
2 would be completed after day 20, and Task 3 would be completed after day 30, as shown
in Figure 6-10a. However, because many people in this situation try to please all three people
who need their tasks completed, they often work on the first task for some time, then the
second, then the third, then go back to the first task, and so on, as shown in Figure 6-10b.
In this example, the tasks were all half-done one at a time, then completed one at a time.
Task 1 is now completed at the end of day 20 instead of day 10, Task 2 is completed at the
end of day 25 instead of day 20, and Task 3 is still completed on day 30. This example illustrates
how multitasking can delay task completions. Multitasking also often involves wasted
setup time, which increases total duration.

Chapter 6
Critical chain scheduling assumes that resources do not multitask or at least minimize
multitasking. Someone should not be assigned to two tasks simultaneously on the same project
when critical chain scheduling is in effect. Likewise, critical chain theory suggests that
projects be prioritized so people working on more than one project at a time know which
tasks take priority. Preventing multitasking avoids resource conflicts and wasted setup time
caused by shifting between multiple tasks over time.
An essential concept to improving project finish dates with critical chain scheduling is
to change the way people make task estimates. Many people add a safety or buffer, which
is additional time to complete a task, to an estimate to account for various factors. These
factors include the negative effects of multitasking, distractions and interruptions, fear that
estimates will be reduced, Murphy s Law, and so on. Murphy’s Law states that if something
can go wrong, it will. Critical chain scheduling removes buffers from individual tasks and
instead creates a project buffer, which is additional time added before the project s due
date. Critical chain scheduling also protects tasks on the critical chain from being delayed
by using feeding buffers, which consist of additional time added before tasks on the critical
chain that are preceded by non-critical-path tasks.
Figure 6-11 provides an example of a network diagram constructed using critical chain
scheduling. Note that the critical chain accounts for a limited resource, X, and the schedule
includes use of feeding buffers and a project buffer in the network diagram. The tasks
marked with an X are part of the critical chain, which can be interpreted as being the critical
path using this technique. The task estimates in critical chain scheduling should be
shorter than traditional estimates because they do not include their own buffers. Not having
task buffers should mean less occurrence of Parkinson’s Law, which states that work
expands to fill the time allowed. The feeding and project buffers protect the date that really
needs to be met the project completion date.

Project Time Management
Several organizations have reported successes with critical chain scheduling. For example,
the U.S. health care industry is learning to think differently by using the Theory of Constraints.
Consider a relatively simple system of a physician s office or clinic. The steps
in the process could be patients checking in, filling out forms, having vital signs
taken by a nurse, seeing the physician, seeing the nurse for a prescribed procedure
such as vaccination, and so forth. These steps could take place in a simple
linear sequence or chain . . . This process or chain only can produce an average
of eight per hour. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the rate of the
slowest resource in this example, the weakest link, is eight. This is true regardless
of how fast each of the other resources can process individually, how much work
is stuffed into the pipeline, or how complex the process or set of interconnected
processes is to complete. Moreover, improving the performance of any link
besides the constraint does nothing to improve the system as a whole. 7
As you can see, critical chain scheduling is a fairly complicated yet powerful tool that
involves critical path analysis, resource constraints, and changes in how task estimates are
made in terms of buffers. Some consider critical chain scheduling one of the most important
new concepts in the field of project management.
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
Another project time management technique is the Program Evaluation and Review
Technique (PERT) a network analysis technique used to estimate project duration when
there is a high degree of uncertainty about the individual activity duration estimates. PERT
applies the critical path method (CPM) to a weighted average duration estimate. This
approach was developed about the same time as CPM, in the late 1950s, and also uses network
diagrams, which are still sometimes referred to as PERT charts.
PERT uses probabilistic time estimates duration estimates based on using optimistic,
most likely, and pessimistic estimates of activity durations instead of one specific or
discrete duration estimate, as CPM does. In other words, PERT uses a three-point estimate,
as described earlier. To use PERT, you calculate a weighted average for the duration estimate
of each project activity using the following formula:
PERT weighted average
optimistic time 4 most likely time pessimistic time
6
By using the PERT weighted average for each activity duration estimate, the total
project duration estimate takes into account the risk or uncertainty in the individual
activity estimates.
Suppose Sue Johnson s project team in the opening case used PERT to determine the
schedule for the online registration system project. They would have to collect numbers for
the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic duration estimates for each project activity. Suppose
one of the activities was to design an input screen for the system. Someone might estimate
that it would take about two weeks or 10 workdays to do this activity. Without using
PERT, the duration estimate for that activity would be 10 workdays. Using PERT, the project
team would also need to estimate the pessimistic and optimistic times for completing
this activity. Suppose an optimistic estimate is that the input screen can be designed in
236
Chapter 6
eight workdays, and a pessimistic time estimate is 24 workdays. Applying the PERT formula,
you get the following:
PERT weighted average
8 workdays 4 10 workdays 24 workdays
6
12 work days
Instead of using the most likely duration estimate of 10 workdays, the project team
would use 12 workdays when doing critical path analysis. These additional two days could
really help the project team in getting the work completed on time.
The main advantage of PERT is that it attempts to address the risk associated with duration
estimates. Since many projects exceed schedule estimates, PERT may help in developing
schedules that are more realistic. PERT s main disadvantages are that it involves more
work than CPM since it requires several duration estimates, and there are better probabilistic
methods for assessing schedule risk (see the information on Monte Carlo simulations in
Chapter 11, Project Risk Management).

The final process in project time management is controlling the schedule. Like scope control,
schedule control is a portion of the integrated change control process under project
integration management. The goal of schedule control is to know the status of the schedule,
influence the factors that cause schedule changes, determine that the schedule has changed,
and manage changes when they occur.
The main inputs to schedule control are the project management plan, project schedule,
work performance data, and organizational process assets. Some of tools and techniques
include:
Progress reports
A schedule change control system, operated as part of the integrated change
control system described in Chapter 4, Project Integration Management
A scheduling tool and/or project management software, such as Project 2007
or similar software
Schedule comparison bar charts, such as the Tracking Gantt chart
Variance analysis, such as analyzing float or slack
What-if scenario analysis, which can be done manually or with the aid of
software
Adjusting leads and lags
Schedule compression, such as crashing and fast-tracking described earlier in
this chapter
Performance measurement, such as earned value, described in Chapter 7, Project
Cost Management
Resource leveling, as described in Chapter 9, Project Human Resource
Management
The main outputs of schedule control include work performance measurements, organizational
process assets updates, such as lessons-learned reports related to schedule control,
change requests, project management plan updates, and project document updates.
237
Project Time Management
There are many issues involved in controlling changes to project schedules. It is important
first to ensure that the project schedule is realistic. Many projects, especially in information
technology, have very unrealistic schedule expectations. It is also important to use
discipline and leadership to emphasize the importance of following and meeting project
schedules. Although the various tools and techniques assist in developing and managing
project schedules, project managers must handle several people-related issues to keep projects
on track. Most projects fail because of people issues, not from failure to draw a good
PERT chart. 8 Project managers can perform a number of reality checks that will help them
manage changes to project schedules. Several soft skills can help project managers to
control schedule changes.
Reality Checks on Scheduling and the Need for Discipline
It is important for projects to have realistic schedule goals and for project managers to use
discipline to help meet those goals. One of the first reality checks a project manager should
make is to review the draft schedule usually included in the project charter. Although this
draft schedule might include only a project start and end date, the project charter sets some
initial schedule expectations for the project. Next, the project manager and his or her team
should prepare a more detailed schedule and get stakeholders approval. To establish the
schedule, it is critical to get involvement and commitment from all project team members,
top management, the customer, and other key stakeholders.
Several experts have written about the lack of realistic schedule estimates for information
technology projects. Ed Yourdon, a well-known and respected software development
expert, describes death march projects as projects doomed for failure from the start, due
to unclear and/or unrealistic expectations, especially for meeting time constraints.9 For
example, in 2008, twenty months after a project was started to overhaul and integrate more
than 300 key IT systems for the city of Portland, Oregon, the city changed IT consultants
as the cost and schedule for the project continued to increase. Robert Stoll, a Portland attorney
representing Ariston Consulting & Technologies, Inc. in the termination negotiations
with the city, said Ariston did the best it could do with the information it was given by the
city. From Ariston s point of view, he said, city officials who prepared the project requirements
and put it out for bid weren t familiar enough with their overall IT systems and needs,
making the goal for the work an impossible target to hit a death march project. It s sort
of garbage in, garbage out, if you know what I mean, Stoll said. I certainly don t think that
Ariston made any mistakes. 10
Experts in chaos theory suggest that project managers must account not only for project
risks based upon their inaccuracies in estimation, but also for the complex behavior
of the organization brought on by multiple independent project managers who also must
estimate project risks. The interdependencies of such a complex system will typically
result in a generally predictable inefficiency. They propose that this inefficiency can be
addressed by arranging for additional resources to be committed to the project. Using an
analogy related to the behavior of traffic systems, they suggest that project managers
schedule resources on the project so that no single resource is utilized more than
75 percent. The actual inefficiency estimate can and should be assessed for each individual
organization, but typically will vary between 70 and 80 percent.11 It is very important,
therefore, to set realistic project schedules and allow for contingencies throughout the life
of a project.
238
Chapter 6
Another type of reality check comes from progress meetings with stakeholders. The
project manager is responsible for keeping the project on track, and key stakeholders like
to stay informed, often through high-level periodic reviews. Managers like to see progress
made on projects approximately each month. Project managers often illustrate progress
with a Tracking Gantt chart showing key deliverables and activities. The project manager
needs to understand the schedule, including why activities are or are not on track, and take
a proactive approach to meeting stakeholder expectations. It is also important to verify
schedule progress, as Sue Johnson from the opening case discovered (see the Case Wrap-Up).
Just because a team member says a task was completed on time does not always mean that
it was. Project managers must review the actual work and develop a good relationship with
team members to ensure work is completed as planned or changes are reported as
needed.
Top management hates surprises, so the project manager must be clear and honest in
communicating project status. By no means should project managers create the illusion that
the project is going fine when, in fact, it is having serious problems. When serious conflicts
arise that could affect the project schedule, the project manager must alert top management
and work with them to resolve the conflicts.
Project managers must also use discipline to control project schedules. Several information
technology project managers have discovered that setting firm dates for key project
milestones helps minimize schedule changes. It is very easy for scope creep to raise its ugly
head on information technology projects. Insisting that important schedule dates be met
and that proper planning and analysis be completed up front helps everyone focus on doing
what is most important for the project. This discipline results in meeting project
schedules.
WH A T WE N T R I G H T ?
A recent example of using discipline and strong user involvement to meet project schedules
comes from a winner of Poland s Project Excellence Award in 2007. Mittal Steel Poland is
part of ArcelorMittal which is the world s number one steel company, with 320,000 employees
in more than 60 countries. The main goal of Mittal Steel Poland s Implementation of
SAP System project was to unify IT systems with other Mittal branches in Europe and to
improve business and financial processes.12 Research by AMR found that 46 percent of ERP
licenses are unused, leaving many users with unnecessary support and maintenance bills.
Derek Prior, research director at AMR Research, identified three things the most successful
SAP implementation projects do to deliver business benefits:
Form a global competence centre. You need a team, including IT professionals
and business analysts, who understand the intricacies of how the software is set
up in your company and the business processes it enables.
Identify super-users for each location. These need to be business managers keen
to use the software to its full capacity who also have the respect of their local
business peers so they can spread the message on what the software offers.
You need ongoing involvement of managers in business processes so they feel
they own these processes. 13

Several types of software are available to assist in project time management. Software for
facilitating communications helps project managers exchange schedule-related information
with project stakeholders. Decision support models can help project managers analyze various
trade-offs that can be made related to schedule issues. However, project management
software, such as Microsoft Project 2007, was designed specifically for performing project
management tasks. You can use project management software to draw network diagrams,
determine the critical path for a project, create Gantt charts, and report, view, and filter
specific project time management information.
Many projects involve hundreds of tasks with complicated dependencies. After you
enter the necessary information, project management software automatically generates a
network diagram and calculates the critical path(s) for the project. It also highlights the critical
path in red on the network diagram. Project management software also calculates the
free and total float or slack for all activities. For example, the data in Table 6-1 was created
using Microsoft Project by selecting the schedule table view from the menu bar. Using project
management software eliminates the need to perform cumbersome calculations
manually and allows for what if analysis as activity duration estimates or dependencies
change. Recall that knowing which activities have the most slack gives the project manager
an opportunity to reallocate resources or make other changes to compress the schedule or
help keep it on track.
Project 2007 easily creates Gantt charts and Tracking Gantt charts, which make tracking
actual schedule performance versus the planned or baseline schedule much easier. It
is important, however, to enter actual schedule information in a timely manner in order to
benefit from using the Tracking Gantt chart feature. Some organizations use e-mail or other
communications software to send up-to-date task and schedule information to the person
responsible for updating the schedule. He or she can then quickly authorize these updates
and enter them directly into the project management software. This process provides an
accurate and up-to-date project schedule in Gantt chart form.
Project 2007 also includes many built-in reports, views, and filters to assist in project
time management. For example, a project manager can quickly run a report to list all tasks
that are to start soon. He or she could then send out a reminder to the people responsible for
these tasks. If the project manager were presenting project schedule information to top
management, he or she could create a Gantt chart showing only summary tasks or milestones.
You can also create custom reports, views, tables, and filters. See Appendix A to

Words of Caution on Using Project Management Software
Many people misuse project management software because they do not understand the concepts
behind creating a network diagram, determining the critical path, or setting a schedule
baseline. They might also rely too heavily on sample files or templates in developing
their own project schedules. Understanding the underlying concepts (even being able to
work with the tools manually) is critical to successful use of project management software,
as is understanding the specific needs of your project.

Many top managers, including software professionals, have made blatant errors using
various versions of Microsoft Project and similar tools. For example, one top manager did
not know about establishing dependencies among project activities and entered every
single start and end date for hundreds of activities. When asked what would happen if the
project started a week or two late, she responded that she would have to reenter all of the
dates.
This manager did not understand the importance of establishing relationships among
the tasks. Establishing relationships among tasks allows the software to update formulas
automatically when the inputs change. If the project start date slips by one week, the project
management software will update all the other dates automatically, as long as they are not
hard-coded into the software. (Hard-coding involves entering all activity dates manually
instead of letting the software calculate them based on durations and relationships.) If one
activity cannot start before another ends, and the first activity s actual start date is two days
late, the start date for the succeeding activity will automatically be moved back two days.
To achieve this type of functionality, tasks that have relationships must be linked in project
management software.
Another top manager on a large information technology project did not know about setting
a baseline in Microsoft Project. He spent almost one day every week copying and pasting
information from Microsoft Project into a spreadsheet and using complicated IF
statements to figure out what activities were behind schedule. He had never received any
training on Microsoft Project and did not know about many of its capabilities. To use any
software effectively, users must have adequate training in the software and an understanding
of its underlying concepts.
Many project management software programs also come with templates or sample files.
It is very easy to use these files without considering unique project needs. For example, a
project manager for a software development project can use the Microsoft Project Software
Development template file, the files containing information from similar projects done in the
past, or sample files purchased from other companies. All of these files include suggested
tasks, durations, and relationships. There are benefits to using templates or sample files,
such as less setup time and a reality check if the project manager has never managed this
type of project before. However, there are also drawbacks to this approach. There are many
assumptions in these template files that may not apply to the project, such as a design phase
that takes three months to complete or the performance of certain types of testing. Project
managers and their teams may over-rely on templates or sample files and ignore unique
concerns for their particular projects.

Project Time Management
C A S E WR A P - U P
It was now March 15, just a month and a half before the new online registration system was
supposed to go live. The project was in total chaos. Sue Johnson thought she could handle
all of the conflicts that kept appearing on the project, and she was too proud to admit to her
top management or the college president that things were not going well. She spent a lot
of time preparing a detailed schedule for the project, and she thought she was using their
project management software well enough to keep up with project status. However, the five
main programmers on the project all figured out a way to generate automatic updates for
their tasks every week, saying that everything was completed as planned. They paid very little
attention to the actual plan and hated filling out status information. Sue did not verify
most of their work to check that it was actually completed. In addition, the head of the
Registrar s Office was uninterested in the project and delegated sign-off responsibility to
one of his clerks who really did not understand the entire registration process. When Sue
and her team started testing the new system, she learned they were using last year s course
data. Using last year s course data caused additional problems because the college was moving
from quarters to semesters in the new semester. How could they have missed that
requirement? Sue hung her head in shame as she walked into a meeting with her manager
to ask for help. She learned the hard way how difficult it was to keep a project on track. She
wished she had spent more time talking face-to-face with key project stakeholders, especially
her programmers and the Registrar s Office representatives, to verify that the project was
on schedule and that the schedule was updated accurately.

Chapter Summary
Project time management is often cited as the main source of conflict on projects. Most information
technology projects exceed time estimates. The main processes involved in project time management
include defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity resources, estimating
activity durations, developing the schedule, and controlling the schedule.
Defining activities involves identifying the specific activities that must be done to produce the
project deliverables. It usually results in a more detailed WBS.
Sequencing activities determines the relationships or dependencies between activities. Three
reasons for creating relationships are that they are mandatory based on the nature of the work,
discretionary based on the project team's experience, or external based on non-project activities.
Activity sequencing must be done in order to use critical path analysis.
Network diagrams are the preferred technique for showing activity sequencing. The two methods
used for creating these diagrams are the arrow diagramming method and the precedence
diagramming method. There are four types of relationships between tasks: finish-to-start, finishto-
finish, start-to-start, and start-to-finish.
Estimating activity resources involves determining the quantity and type of resources (people,
equipment, and materials) that will be assigned to each activity. The nature of the project and the
organization will affect resource estimating.
Estimating activity durations creates estimates for the amount of time it will take to complete
each activity. These time estimates include the actual amount of time worked plus elapsed time.
Developing the schedule uses results from all of the other project time management
processes to determine the start and end dates for the project. Project managers often use Gantt
charts to display the project schedule. Tracking Gantt charts show planned and actual schedule
information.
The critical path method predicts total project duration. The critical path for a project is the
series of activities that determines the earliest completion date for the project. It is the longest path
through a network diagram. If any activity on the critical path slips, the whole project will slip unless
the project manager takes corrective action.
Crashing and fast tracking are two techniques for shortening project schedules. Project managers
and their team members must be careful about accepting unreasonable schedules, especially
for information technology projects.
Critical chain scheduling is an application of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) that uses critical
path analysis, resource constraints, and buffers to help meet project completion dates.
The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a network analysis technique
used to estimate project duration when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the individual
activity duration estimates. It uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates of activity
durations. PERT is seldom used today.
Controlling the schedule is the final process in project time management. Even though scheduling
techniques are very important, most projects fail because of people issues, not from a poor
network diagram. Project managers must involve all stakeholders in the schedule development
process. It is critical to set realistic project schedules and use discipline to meet schedule goals.
Project management software can assist in project scheduling if used properly. With project
management software, you can avoid the need to perform cumbersome calculations manually and
perform what if analysis as activity duration estimates or dependencies change. Many people
misuse project management software because they do not understand the concepts behind
creating a network diagram, determining the critical path, or setting a schedule baseline. Project
managers must also avoid over-relying on sample files or templates when creating their unique
project schedules.

Information
3.3 Time planning 
The essential of time planning is to create and update a project schedule diagram called Gantt Chart. A Gantt chart, or harmonogram, is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule2. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities.

Figure 8: An example of a Gantt chart for a web application development project 
Similarly to Section 3.2, we present here common mistakes when students firstly making Gantt charts: 
• This is not a Gantt chart: there are common conventions about drawing Gantt chart. Students should use existing templates for visualizing their Gantt Chart, and not invent their own notations. Microsoft Office provides a template as a Excel document3, but you can find various templates in other software online. 
• Right size of Gantt chart: as seen in Figure 8, the overview of the whole project is capture in one screen. It is possible to go in details of the WBS and have the correspondingly timeline for each task. However, keep in mind that too many details can make it difficult to watch the overview. Some modern project management tools might provide features to dynamically switch between views of Gantt Chart. However, most of the free templates will not give you the capacity. 
• Forget to add milestones: Gantt chart includes not only timeline for activities, but also important milestones, such as Sprint review meeting, User acceptance testing, Project final presentation, and Final exam date. Visualizing milestones will guide the adjustment of time plan to meet project deadlines. 
• Forget to update Gantt chart: similar to WBS, time plan can change over time. There is also a need to update the schedule chart when WBS is updated. Maintaining an accurate version of WBS is important to have a correct view on the project progress and the time plan till the end of the project.
